NEAR POTATO HILL, May 10, 1864-6.30 a. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Twenty-third Army Corps, Department of the Ohio:

The cavalry column sent out this morning to make the demonstration toward Dalton. The skirmishes are at its base, and also occupy the ridge west of the railroad. Colonel Dorr reports strong indications of the hill being evacuated, and that sine 12 o'clock the enemy has been moving wagon trains to the rear. Our skirmishing has not been very heavy, and the hill looks quiet. This is the hill which commands both of these valleys, and if fortified.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.
