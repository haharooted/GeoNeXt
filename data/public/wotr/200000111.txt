Major-General BUTLER.

CAMP AT NEW KENT, February 7, 1864-10 p. m.

My cavalry reached Bottom's Bridge at 2. 50 a. m. to-day and found the enemy in strong force. Owing to the peculiar darkness of the night it was impossible to attack till daylight. Enemy had four batteries artillery and certainly three regiments infantry, besides cavalry, and were all night and this morning receiving accessions by railroad. Bridge taken up, and all the fords effectually obstructed. A charge on the best-looking ford was gallantry but unsuccessfully executed by Major Wheelan with detachment of Onderdonk's mounted rifles. Loss, 9 killed and wounded; 10 horses killed. At 12 m. to-day, my infantry having arrived by forced marches within 7 miles, I withdrew; could have carried the position with infantry, but not worth while, the main object being defeated. Enemy pursued us to near this place; attacked us at Baltimore Store. Were handsomely repulsed with loss by Third New York Cavalry, Colonel Lewis, and one piece of Belger's battery. Expect an attack to-morrow.
