HDQRS. COMPANY M, FIRST MO. STATE MIL. CAV.,
Hall's Mills, Mo., April 10, 1864.

Colonel JAMES McFERRAN,

1st Cav., Mo. S. M., Commanding 3rd Sub-Dist., Warrensburg, Mo.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report to you that the men under my command have been on nine scouts within the last ten days, and have traveled in the aggregate 1,440 miles, being equal to 17 30/77 miles' travel to each man. We find the country all quiet and the people generally at work with all their force preparing for their spring crops. We have neither seen nor heard of any bushwhackers on the contrary find the people generally well disposed toward the Government and desirous to submit to all military orders. We find forage rather scarce in the country, but up to the present we have been able to get full rations for our horses.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES D. EADS,

Captain Company M, First Cav., Missouri State Militia.
