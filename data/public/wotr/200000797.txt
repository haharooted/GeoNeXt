SIOUX CITY, May 30, 1864.

Brigadier General H. H. SIBLEY:

Troops leave Sioux City to-day; will leave Fort Pierre about 20th June; reach Swan Lake July 1. Your troops had better strike for that point. Indians above there. When they cross the James River send scouts down Nicollet's trail toward Pierre. I will send up to meet them.

ALF. SULLY,

Brigadier-General.
