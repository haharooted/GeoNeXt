Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., September 30, 1862.

Major J. S. RINEARSON,

First Oregon Cavalry, Commanding Camp Lapwai, Wash. Ter.:

SIR: Rumors have reached these headquarters that white men, lost alike to a sense of duty and humanity, are mixing among the Indians in your locality, instilling into their minds a disregard for the peace of the frontiers, and under a pretext that the Government is powerless to protect or punish, to incite them to revolt, and with it all the horrors of rapine and murder. The general commanding directs that you arrest and hold subject to his disposition any person or persons caught in the act (or when reliable information is furnished you of such fact) of inciting, advising, or in any way encouraging disaffection and revolt among the Indians. While you are expected to use these instructions with discretion, you are nevertheless to act with promptitued and vigor, and not to hesitate, if necessary, to tuse the force at your command for the purpose above set forth. Similar instructions have been furnished to Colonel J. Steinberger, commanding at Fort Walla Walla.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FREDERICK MEARS,

First Lieutenant, Ninth Infantry, U. S. Army, Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
