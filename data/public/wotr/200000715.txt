CAPE GIRARDEAU, May 31, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding:

Our boys killed 2 of the guerrillas who cut the telegraph line Thursday. On their return they got after another and he took to the swamp. Our boys dismounted and, after a chase of some distance through about 3 feet of water, killed him. I start a party to-morrow to kill the balance.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
