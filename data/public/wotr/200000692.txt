FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 30, 1864

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Please respond to my request of the 9th asking permission to issue ammunition to militia; also give me leave to extend telegraph from Lawrence to Fort Riley. Am trying to keep rebels and Indians down. Matters favorable but difficult.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
