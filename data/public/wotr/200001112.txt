HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,
Mesilla, September 11, 1862.

Colonel GEORGE W. BOWIE,

Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, Fort Yuma, Cal.:

Brigadier-General CArleton, when leaving this district a few days since to assume command of the Department of New Mexico, desired me to request you to do him the favor to give your attention to the following matters: Should Lieutenant Bennett, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, superintendent of vedettes, be in your district or vicinity, be good enough to order him to report at these headquarters by first opportunity. I understood the general to say that this would leave the vedettes between Fort Yuma and Los Angeles without a superintendent, and that it was his desire that the regularity of their services should be maintained. The general also requests that you will do him the favor to release and send to California a political prisoner named J. S. Bratton on his taking the oath of allegiance.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
