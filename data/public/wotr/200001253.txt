DEPUTY QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

San Francisco, June 3, 1863

Lieutenant-Colonel DRUM.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Present:

Camp Wright has hitherto been furnished via Fort Bragg, from which latter post it is distant sixty-five miles. I know of no more eligible route. They have forty-nine pack-mules and trappings and one wagon at Camp Wright.

Respectfully,

E. B. BABBITT,

Deputy Quartermaster-General.
