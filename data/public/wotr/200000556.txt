GRAND ECORE, April 11, 1864.

Major-General STEELE:

We have met the enemy in full force on the 8th and 9th and beat him both times, but have been compelled to fall back for want of water. His force is 22,000. Smith, Price, Green, and Taylor are here. Mouton is killed. The enemy will attack us, or assault you in force. Both must be ready. I shall communicate with you as often as possible.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
