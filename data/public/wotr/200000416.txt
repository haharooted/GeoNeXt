FORT LEAVENWORTH, April 16, 1864.

General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Dispatch came while I was absent. Kansas and Indian country stripped to strengthen Steele. Steele's move does not cover my department, and I fear repetition of raids and massacres. Kansas, you know, has suffered most, and, like Missouri and Kentucky, needs more than militia to save her. I wish I had force to move down through the prairie country west of Arkansas, where grass and cattle make it more convenient to campaign, and turn enemy's left flank and seize the valleys that lead though Texas. Such a route avoids mountains and timber. But success, general, to your central movement. I will do all in my power.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
