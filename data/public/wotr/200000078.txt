HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,
Tunnel Hill, May 10, 1864-4 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD,

Field:

GENERAL: Will complete the change after daylight slowly and gradually. I do not know that the rebels will attack you, but they may, and you ought to see that we ought to swing toward our right instead of strengthening our left. Make the change so as to give you as good a connection with Newton as possible, but in any event keep up your connection with the right.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
