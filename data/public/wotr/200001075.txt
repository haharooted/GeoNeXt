COLLIERVILLE, June 12, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

GENERAL: What I know a force moving toward White's Station was reported to me. I have everything I want. It is reported that the One hundred and eighth [Illinois] Regiment was near La Grange this morning, organized, with plenty of ammunition, and commanded by the adjutant.

It will get in safe no doubt. I am just about withdrawing to White's Station as it is precarious here.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
