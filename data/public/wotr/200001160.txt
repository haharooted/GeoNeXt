Fort Walla Walla, October 19, 1862.

Colonel R. F. MAURY,

First Oregon Cavalry, Commanding Emigrant Road Expedition:

SIR: I am directed by the commanding general of the district, now at this post, to inform you that it is his wish that you reach this post with your command as soon as possible consistent with the safety and good condition of your troops, and without any reference to his instructions to remain in the field until the 1st of November. Have the muster and pay rolls of your field and staff and companies of your command made out ready for muster and inspection on the 31st of this month. It is desired that the muster should take place here, and the sooner you arrive here the better, unless some pressing necessity connected with the object of your expedition compels delay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUSTUS STEINBERGER,

Colonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding.
