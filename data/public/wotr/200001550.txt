HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,
June 11, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose you copy of communication+ received this day from Colonel William A. Howard, commanding Thirteenth Regiment New York Volunteer Artillery, and would respectfully suggest that this regiment, with the boats referred to, be ordered to this department. Colonel Howard has served with me in North Carolina, and it was on my suggestions that the boats were built. They can be of great service in this department, being particularly adapted to these waters, as they are of light draught, and can navigate the internal passages from Morris Island to Florida. There are other reason why I think the service would be benefitted by having these here, viz: First. They will answer for the purposes of transportation. Second. They can be used for landing troops, owing to their extreme light draught, being able to run quite up to the shore, and allowing the troops to disembark without employing surf-boats or bateaux. Third. They will be serviceable as fighting boats, at their sides are protected by bullet-proof iron plating, and are furnished with proper accommodations and arrangements for guns.

Should it be deemed inadvisable to order the regiment with all the boats here, I trust you will be able to send me the two boats now nearly ready for sea in New York, with a battalion of the regiment. I am particularly anxious to have these boats ordered here, as this department was in a great measure stripped of steamers by General Gillmore for the transportation of the Tenth Army Corps from this place.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
