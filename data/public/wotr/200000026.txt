IN THE FIELD, May 10, 1864-1.30 a. m.

Colonel J. B. DORR,

Commanding First Brigade:

The colonel commanding directs that you make a demonstration on the Dalton road at dawn of day in the morning, and gain the earliest possible information of any movement of the enemy on the left flank of the infantry. It is expected that the enemy will attack our left in the morning, and it is of vital importance that early information should be gathered of their movements. In making this demonstration it will be necessary to throw a small party of your command into the valley and ridge along the railroad, in order to protect your left. Leave a detachment with the artillery where it is for a support. I will be on the Dalton road, where you can send information.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT LE ROY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
