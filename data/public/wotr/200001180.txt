CAMP LINCOLN, CAL., October 9, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform the general commanding that a large number of the Humboldt County Indians, recently placed upon Smith's River Valley Reservation, have escaped. The number approximates 400, including all the worst men. So soon as I could learn the direction they had taken, Captain M. O'Brien, Second Infantry California Volunteers, was dispatched in pursuit and returned to camp without success. Information has since been received that they rafted themselves across the Klamath, proceeding south. Indians inclined to leave Smith's River Reservation can do so at any time, favored by the forest of redwoods by which it is surrounded and by the topography of the country.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES F. CURTIS,

Major Second Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding Camp.
