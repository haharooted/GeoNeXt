DECATUR, May 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General SMITH, Huntsville:

General Gresham has part of his command at Athens, part at Elk River, balance at Pulaski. Nothing new this morning. I am satisfied that it is a mistake that the force over the river is Roddey's command.

It must be Forrest.

J. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
