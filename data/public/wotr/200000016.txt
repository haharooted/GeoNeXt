HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,
Tunnel Hill, May 10, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

DEAR GENERAL: I have just sent Major McCoy to see you about a movement through Snake Creek Gap, on Resaca, thus opening Dalton. We hold Snake Creek to its debouch into Sugar Valley, and to force a passage by the north would separate our forces too much and push Johnston more compact; and to pass Buzzard Roost would be to enter the very trap prepared for us. Your report of withdrawal is perfectly satisfactory, and was described to me by Captain Pe, as seen from the mountain, as very handsome. Let me hear from you on the subject of my first note, and state specifically the position of all your troops at 12 m. to-day, as you understood them, Stoneman included.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
