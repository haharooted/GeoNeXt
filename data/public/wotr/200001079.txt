LOUISVILLE, June 12, 1864-3 p. m.

Captain DICKSON:

I have, exclusive of convalescents, about 400 men. I have barely enough on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to make fight in the forts; not a mann to spare without stripping the line and placing it in a defenseless condition. I have sent 500 cavalry to Frankfort; they will arrive there this evening.

HUGH EWING,

Brigadier-General.
