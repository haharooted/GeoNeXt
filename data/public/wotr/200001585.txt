COMMANDING OFFICER AT FORT WALLA WALLA, WASH. TER.:

SIR: Your letter of the 8th instant is received stating that application for relief is frequently made to you by emigrants arriving from the east of the Rocky Mountains, who are destitute of provisions, and you request instructions for your guidance in such cases, I cannot find anything in the Regulations on the subject, but in cases of such suffering and destitution among those arriving this autumn with that emigration, you are authorized to order the issue of such articles of subsistence to them for a limited period as may be necessary. I shall desire you to use your discretion in each case as to the necessary, having instituted such investigation of each case as to satisfy you of the existence of real destitution.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
