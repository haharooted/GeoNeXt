CITY POINT, VA., July 24, 1864-5.30 p. m. (Received 10 a. m., 25th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

Please direct General Foster to order Brigadier General William Birney to report to General Butler, if his services can be dispensed with. His brigade might be brought here if General Foster thinks he can do without it. Whilst operations continue here much cannot be done in the Department of the South except to hold what we have got.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
