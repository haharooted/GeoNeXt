WARRENSBURG, MO., June 3, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Two bodies of guerrillas, one of 120 and one of 70, seen in Lawrence County this morning and last night. Commanding officer at Lexington reports that he is credibly informed that there are 600 between this county and the Missouri River. I do not credit it, though it may be true.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
