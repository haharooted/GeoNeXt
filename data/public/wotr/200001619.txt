HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, Cal., September 11, 1862.

Colonel GEORGE W. BOWIE,

Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding Fort Yuma, Cal.:

SIR: The general commanding the department directs that as soon after the receipt of this order as practicable three companies of your regiment, with your headquarters, will take up the line of march for New San Pedro, and go into camp at or near old Camp Drum. You will withdraw from Fort Barrett one company of your regiment, which, with the one left by you, will constitute the garrison of Fort Yuma, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Dobbins. You will bring with your command one of the two ambulances at Fort Yuma. The general suggests as a better plan to send your command over by companies, and if you have not transportation for all, the first company will be sent as far as Camp Wright, and the transportation can return to Fort Yuma for the balance. District headquarters will after your arrival be established at the camp near New San Pedro.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
