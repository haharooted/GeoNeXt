HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISIPPI,
Tunnel Hill, Ga., May 10, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: By direction of the general commanding, you will please order Major-General Hooker to support General McPherson at Snake Creek Gap, directing your nest division to General Geary to watch the road Geary is occupying. The general directs me also to say his judgment is that both Howard's and Palmer's troops would be required and necessary to make the game sure. General Garrard has been heard from. He left La Fayette this morning for Villanow, &c. General Stoneman is also heard from, and will be up at Vernell's with one brigade to-night and the balance to-morrow.

I am, general, very respectfully, yours,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

P. S.-Your second note just received, and the general will discuss the matter with you to-night.
