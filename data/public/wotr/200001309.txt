HDQRS. FIRST CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEER CAVALRY,
Fort Thorn, Ariz., July 14, 1862.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report the arrival here on yesterday of another express from General Canby, the second one alluded to in Colonel Chivington's communication of the 7th instant.

I leave here to-morrow morning with my command for Mesilla. On examination found the road from here to Rough and Ready Station impracticable, and have determined tomake a road to the San Diego Crossing, and then pass the river on a raft, which I am now having made for that purpose, and which will be floated down to the crossing. The road on the east side of the river from San Diego to Mesilla is good. It is my determination, unless otherwise ordered, to hoist the national colors over Mesilla and Forts Fillmore and Bliss before the end of the present month.

I neglected in my report of the march to this place to give the names of the men killed by the Indians at Apache Pass. Their names are Privates James F. Keith, Peter Maloney, and Albert Schmidt, of Company B, First California Volunteer Cavalry.

I am, lieutenant, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. E. YERE,

Lieutenant-Colonel First California Volunteer Cavalry, Commanding

Lieutenant BENJAMIN C. CUTLER,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Column from California, Tucson, Ariz.
