GENERAL ORDERS,
 HDQRS. DIST. OF CENTRAL MISSOURI, Numbers 4. Jefferson, City, Mo., January 26, 1864.

I. It having come to the knowledge of the general commanding that a large number of slaves who are capable of performing the duties of soldiers have escaped from their owners, and are employed as servants and laborers, and that in some cases they are not permitted or are discouraged from entering the military service, it is hereby ordered that a slave who may be found or known by his master to be thus employed may be taken by him and delivered to the assistant provost-marshal for the purpose of being recruited. Any persons who shall interfered with or attempt to discourage the enlistment of negroes will be reported, together with a full statement of the facts and names of witnesses, to these headquarters, in order that they may be brought before a military commission or general court-martial on the charge of discouraging enlistments.

II. Assistant provost-marshals are hereby directed to recommend, through the assistant provost-marshal of the district, sufficient number of enlisted men, no to exceed 3 to each assistant provost-marshal, to be detailed for the purpose of recruiting soldiers for colored regiments. Recruiting officers and enlisted men detailed for that duty will enlist all able-bodied slaves who may be delivered to them by their owners, or those who leave their homes and masters under the pretense of doing so, for the purpose of entering the army.

By order of Brigadier-General Brown:

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
