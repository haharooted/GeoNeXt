HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC.

San Francisco, November 18, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C. ;

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copyof a letter from Colonel P. E. Connor, Third Infantry California Volunteers, commanding the District of Utah, dated November 6, 1862, also a copy of the report of Major E. McGarry, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, detailing the result of his expedition to capture guerrillas and punish Indians engaged in the late massacres on the Humboldt River. The swift retributive punishment which has been meted out to those Indians will doubtless have the effect of preventing a repetition of their barbarities. It is the only way to deal with those savages.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
