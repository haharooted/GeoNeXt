HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 25, 1864.

Major-General PLEASONTON,
Commanding Cavalry Crops:

The major-general commanding directs me to inquire whether the instructions for General Kilpatrick, as commander of the late expedition against Richmond, sent to him from these headquarters through you, were duly received and acknowledge by him. In his report of that expedition General Kilpatrick omits all mention of our reference to these instructions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
