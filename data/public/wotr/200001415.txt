ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, DISTRICT OF THE FRONTIER, DEPT. OF ARKANSAS, Fort Smith, April 15, 1864.

Mr. MILOR:

Feeling satisfied that you are always pleased to hear from home, I seize the present moment to drop you a few lines. Several skirmishes have taken place since you left, the country being full of guerrillas. Fitzwilliams, with his band of accomplished cut-throats, has been in close proximity with this place for a number of days past. He attacked our train several times between here and Rosewille, but could not effect anything. The organization of the militia will render available service and co-operate very advantageously with the present military forces in this district at present. I inclose you copy of General Orders, Numbers 4. We are pleased to learn that our worthy Governor indorsed its organization. Do what you can for me, judge. I will forward some credentials from commissioned officers in a few days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. C. REID.
