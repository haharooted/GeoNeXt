McGarry, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, and a report from the latter officer of the execution of his orders. In Colonel Connor's communication, it will be observed that he is taking every precaution to guard effectively the Overland Mail Route, and also the telegraph stations; and to his energy and sound judgment may safely be confided that important duty.
