HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Hilton Head, S. C., July 1, 1864.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,
Commanding Confederate Forces,

S. Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your voluminous letter of the 22nd. I wish, however, to be informed definitely whether the intention declared in your letter of the 13th ultimo has been carried into effect. If so, I would respectfully request information as to what portion of the city these officers are now confined. If this question cannot be answered for military reasons, will you inform me of the degree of exposure to which they are subjected; whether in the part of the city most, or in that least, exposed, or that exposed in a medium degree. I would also request you to allow one general officer and one field officer of the said prisoners to subscribe to and send me a statement giving me the kind and quantity of food dealt out to them, also the comforts afforded them in the way of beds, bedding, blankets, &c. The object of these requests is simply to ascertain the exact manner in which these officers are treated, that I may treat in the same manner a like number of your officer now confined in Charleston. I have not yet placed your prisoners in a similar position of exposure.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
