CHARLESTON, S. C., April 14, 1864.

The demand here for troops is now so urgent, I must ask suspension until return of forces sent from South Carolina to Florida of paragraph 38, Order 22, disbanding certain troops in this vicinity. Please answer.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.
