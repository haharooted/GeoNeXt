CAPE GIRARDEAU, April 14, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding:

I have information that I think reliable that Kitchen and Clark are now concentrating quite a force at Gainesville. All the citizens are ordered to remove at once. I am satisfied we may expect a raid soon on our outposts. I have scouts out and will endeavor to keep you advised. I think they mean mischief either at Patterson or Bloomfield.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
