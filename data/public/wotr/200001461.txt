HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSOURI,
Vicksburg, Miss., June 3, 1864. (Received 10.45 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington, D. C.:

I have sent an expedition, under Major General A. J. Smith, for the purpose of destroying or capturing the rebel force engaged in the attempt to interrupt the navigation of the Mississippi River near Greenville. General Smith has been re-enforced by cavalry and artillery from this command, making his force about 7,000 effective.

The rebel force is said to be about 5,000 and nearly all mounted. I am making arrangements to have water transportation held in reserve at different points on the river, so as to be able to move troops to any point threatened without the delay that is now necessary.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
