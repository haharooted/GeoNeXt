HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 30, 1864.

Captain CAMERON, Commanding at Cassville, Mo.:

Is there probably any need of retaining all the mounted forces you have at Cassville? If not, what proportion, in your judgment, can be spared?

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
