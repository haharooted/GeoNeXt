 New Orleans, January 21, 1864

The repair, extension, and preservation of the levees in this department are placed under the charge of the provost-marshal-general who is authorized and directed to make an immediate survey of the levees, and to make such requisition for labor and other assistance as may be necessary for the protection of the public works, the people, and the agricultural interests of the department. The charges consequent upon improvements of this character will be assessed upon the adjoining estates, which will also be required to furnish such labor as may be equitable and practicable in the execution of this order.

All communications upon this subject will be addressed to the provost-marshal-general, and all persons having information or interest therein are requested to present their views to his office without delay.
