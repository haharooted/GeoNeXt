HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., April 17, 1864.

GENERAL: I send herewith two views of Fort Sumter, photographed by Mr. George Cook, of this city, form a very accurate drawing of the interior of that work made on the 9th December, 1863, by Lieutenant John R. Key, post adjutant, C. S. Engineers, a young artist of great promise. The photographs have been delayed much longer then had been anticipated, by the want of proper materials and instructions. The fort is now much stronger for defensive purposes than represented by these views, its interior being well arranged for musketry and light artillery fire. There are also four 10-inch columbiads, one 8-inch columbiad rifled, and two rifled 42-pounders, mounted in casemate, bearing on the pass toward Sullivan's Island and on Rebellion roads.

I remain, very truly, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
