PULASKI, TENN., May 9, 1864.

Major General JAMES B. McPHERSON:

Can't hear of Roddey anywhere along the line of the road; don't think he left the Tennessee River. Will move on to Athens. General Force wants you to send a commissary of subsistence here to receive cattle as he forwards them. He has now got 2,500 head at Clifton.

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.
