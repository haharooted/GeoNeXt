HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON.

Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., November 19, 1863.

Colonel R. F. MAURY,

First Oregon Cavalry, commanding expedition

against the Snake Indians, Fort Dalles, Oreg.:

COLONEL: I write to express my sense of the valuable and important services rendered by you and your command during the past season. It was a long march for some of the troops, more than 1,000 miles. It was free from all untoward events, and the privations of the journey were cheerfully endured with soldierly fortitude and alacrity. No one doubts that if the opporutnity had offered the gallant troops under your command would have been distinguished in the face of the enemy. Let them not imagine that the people of this frontier do not appreciate the services your expedition rendered by displaying to the Indians in so many localities the power of the Government. The soldiers of an Oregon regiment have at all events had the satisfaction of seeing in the summer and fall of 1862 and 1863 systematic steps taken for the first time for the protection of the overland emigration. The people of Oregon as well as myself are no doubt ready to express their high appreciation of the honorable manner in which the First Oregon Cavalry have discharged the duties thus devolved upon them.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD.

Brigadier-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
