LEXINGTON, Jun 11, 1864-10. 15 p. m.

Brigadier General H. B. CARRINGTON,

Louisville, Ky.:

I have no reliable news from Frankfort. The cannonading was heard here last night and this morning, supposed to be at Frankfort. Courier just in left General Burbridge at Paris at 7 p. m. The general says if troops are sent to Lexington from Louisville, protect Camp Nelson at all hazards, also that Frankfort should be protected if not already taken. We have very small force here or at Camp Nelson. If you have the troops I think they are needed in this vicinity.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
