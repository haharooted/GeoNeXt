[Inclosure.]

POST ARANSAS, TEX., April 16, 1864.

To all whom it may concern:

This is to certify that Captain Crowell, of the steamer Exact, has landed at this post the troops as per Orders, Numbers 76, from Major-General McClernand, and his instructions from Lieutenant Paddock, acting assistant quartermaster of transportation, being such that, unaccompanied with other orders, I could not understand, and the instructions from Lieutenant-Colonel Pierce being that the boat return at once, I have ordered the captain to return to Pass Cavallo.

Respectfully,

WM. G. THOMPSON,

Major, Commanding Post.
