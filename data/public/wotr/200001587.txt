HEADQUARTERS,
Fort Walla Walla, October 14, 1862.

His Excellency WILLIAM PICKERING,

Governor of Washington Territory, Olympia, Wash. Ter.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that I have this day received a communication from the citizens of Lewiston reporting the imminent prospect of Indian difficulties in their vicinity, and requesting my aid in having troops stationed at or near that place and in the procuration of arms for its defense. I am advised at the same time that a memorial has been forwarded to Your Excellency on this subject. During the month of August intelligence reached me that gave evidence of disaffection among several of the tribes in this portion of the district, and as a precaution in the event of outbreak requisitions were made by the commanding officer of this post for increased supplies of arms and ammunition. William Kelly, esq., the assistant adjutant-general of Washington Territory militia for this section, was also advised to make requisition upon the proper Territorial authorities for ordnance stores suitable to about 250 stand of arms now in his possession. In pursuance of the communication referred to, and in furtherance of the views of the citizens of Lewiston, I have respectfully to recommend their application for arms. The request for troops will no doubt be referred to the general commanding the district, with whom the disposition of the military force in this district rests. I have officially advised him of the matter of this communication.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your Excellency's obedient servant,

JUSTUS STEINBERGER,

Colonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding.
