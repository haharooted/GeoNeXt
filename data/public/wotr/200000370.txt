HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 29, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I sent Geneal Holland and one of my staff officers to Berryville instead of going myself, as he knew all the roads and people. He informs me this morning in his dispatches that the enemy under Colonel Hughes has fallen back to Rolling Prairie, in Searcy County. He will move on them as soon as he can procure rations, which will reach him by to-night. I have no advices yet of the troops operating below them in that region, although Colonel Phelps is rumored to be in the vicinity of Berryville.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
