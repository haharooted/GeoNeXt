HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT DEPT. OF THE SOUTH, Folly Island, S. C., July 11, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM HEINE,

Commanding Post:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that you station the pickets now as heretofore, except that you will send 100 men and a section of the Rocket Battery to Kiawah Island instead of the usual number. The general commanding further directs that the detachment to Kiawah Island be sent to-morrow, 12th instant, and that they proceed with great caution to their post to avoid being ambushed or surprised by the enemy, and that when the outposts are duly stationed and the ground has been examined in the vicinity, that only the usual number remain there and the balance will return to camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. DEAN,

Lieutenant 127th New York Volunteers, A. A. A. G.
