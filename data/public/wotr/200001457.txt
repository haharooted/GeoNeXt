Grand Ecore, La., April 10, 1864.

Brigadier General A. L. LEE, Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you send a sufficient force out the Red River road to-night to thoroughly picket and protect the entrance to that portion of the town. He desires me to inform you that infantry pickets from the Corps d'Afrique will be posted upon all the roads leading into the town upon this side of the river. You will please post vedettes in front of these pickets. He directs that you send a squadron up the Red River road to communicate and come in with a squadron sent from Pleasant Hill to the Red River yesterday.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
