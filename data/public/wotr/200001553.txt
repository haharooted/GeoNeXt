HDQRS. DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH, Jacksonville, July 27, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM H. NOBLE,

Commanding U. S. Forces at Baldwin:

COLONEL: In consequence of orders received from department headquarters directing troops to be sent from this district to Hilton Head, the expedition to Marion and Alachua Counties is deferred. You will retain all the troops you have at Baldwin except the Eighth Regiment U. S. Colored Troops, which will be sent to this place immediately, and you will on no account send out Colonel Harris' command as directed by me yesterday. You will receive all your supplies at present from Camp Milton. All wagon trains you send to that place must be accompanied by a strong escort. General Birney has been ordered immediately to Hilton Head to give his testimony before a general court-martial and will start to-morrow. You will therefore be in command of this district. General Birney is of opinion that you had better remain at Baldwin for the present.

By command of Brigadier-General Birney:

M. BAILEY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
