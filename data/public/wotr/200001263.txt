HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF UTAH,
Camp Douglas, Utah, December 2, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal. ;

COLONEL: I have the honor to inclose a letter of instruction to Major McGarry and his report of the expedition upon which he was sent. The uncle of the boy, who is now at this post, is a resident of Oregon, and, as he informs, me, has been in serach of the boy for two years. Three sisters of his, who were captured at the same time, are dead. He also informs me that three expeditions had previously been sent out from Oregon for the recovery of the children, one of which was under command of Captain Dent, of the Ninth Infantry. The Indians are threatening the Overland Mail Route east and west of here. I have no fears of the western end, as the lessons I have been teaching them and the messages I send them make them fear me. About a week since I sent ten men to protect the telegraph station at Big Sandy, which was threatened by Indians. On Saturday last they stole 100 horses from Fort Bridger Reserve, belonging to some mountaineers, who are wintering there, and fears are entertained that they will attack some of the stations of the Overland Mail. I have therefore ordered Company I, Captain Lewis of my regiment, to garrison Fort Bridger this winter. I shall order detachments of his company to the different stations in this district east of here, if I find it will be necessary. Pacific Springs Station, lately attacked by Indians, is just esat of the line dividing this district and the Department of the West, and has been garrisoned by troops from that department. The telegraph station at Big Sandy is in the District of Oregon. I shall leave the ten men now there at that point until I am satisfied there is no further danger from Indians, unless otherwise ordered.

I have the honor to remain, very ur obedient servant,

P. EDWARD CONNOR,

Colonel Third Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding District.
