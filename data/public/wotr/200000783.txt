HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,
Saint Joseph, Mo., June 2, 1864.

A. ALLEN, Esq.,

Crab Orchard, Mo.:

SIR: I am directed by the general commanding to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 30th instant [ultimo], and to authorize you to kill any bushwhacker you can find engaged in his hellish work. The common law or the law of Missouri does not interfere with rights of citizens to protect themselves or property from the depredations of thieves and outlaws. Military forces will be sent to, or organized in, Ray County for the speedy extermination of desperadoes and the restoration of good order and tranquillity.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
