II. The manifest disregard of private rights in some localities and the total or partial suspension of the civil authorities in others demands that the military authorities should extend protection to the citizens to prevent waste, trespass, and injury to private property. It is therefore ordered that until the civil authority resumes its wonted vigor, all persons be, and they are hereby, prohibited from trespassing upon private property. Citizens and soldiers are strictly prohibited from burning fence rails and destroying fences and defacing house and buildings, under penalty, if citizen, of being arrested and held for trial on the requisition of the civil authority, and, if a soldier, of being arrested and punished for violation of orders. All station and post commanders, officers, and non-commissioned officers, are charged with the enforcement of this order. All well-disposed persons, citizens and citizens and soldiers, are enjoined promptly to report persons violating this order.

By order of James McFerran, colonel First Cavalry Missouri State Militia, commanding regiment and Third Sub-District:

THOS. DOYLE,

Adjutant.
