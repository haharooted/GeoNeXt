SAINT JOSEPH, MO., April 14, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have just returned from a visit to Platte and Clay Cunties. I have every reason to believe that there will be less complaint from that section hereafter. Orders to stop sale of arms and ammunition, as directed in your telegram of 13th instant, have already been promulgated and ordered published. I have visited Andrew County, and set in council with the principal Paw Paw chief. We shall not have further trouble with them. I hope very soon to smoke pipe of peace and exchange presents with the entire tribe. They will stack arms and return to the plow-handle and spades. Everything works well. When will you visit the northwest?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
