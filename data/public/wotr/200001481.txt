FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 31, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department:

Information from Fort Scott informs me that 12 bushwhackers under Henry Taylor entered Lamar, Mo., on yesterday [28th*] and burned ten houses. There were only women and children in the place, the militia having left some days since.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
