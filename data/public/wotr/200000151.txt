HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,
February 7, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that, in accordance with instructions from headquarters Cavalry Corps, I proceeded, on the morning of the 6th, with a portion of my division *(1,360 officers and men and one battery) to Culpeper Ford; crossed at 11 a. m. without opposition. A portion of my people crossed at the same hour at Germanna, above, and Ely's Ford, below. Reconnoitering parties were at once sent out toward Chancellorsville and on the different roads from the Germanna pike, across the stone pike, over to the plank road from Orange Court-House to Fredericksburg. A considerable force under Colonel Alger drove a small body of rebel cavalry on the ridge road to Robertson's Tavern, and thence across to the plank road. Major Cooke, with his regiment, also made a successful reconnaissance up the river above Germanna as far as Jacobs' Ford, capturing the picket at that point. This ended operations for the day, and I went into camp near ---, on the Germanna plank road.

From all that I could learn, the enemy occupy the same position as when our army crossed in November last. He has no considerable force this side of Mine Run. Hampton's cavalry is at Hamilton's Crossing. A large number of his men are without horses or arms; 240 of his men picket the river from Germanna to the United States Ford; only a few of the last detail sent had horses. At 6 a. m. on the 7th I received orders to recross the river and return to camp. At 9 a. m. my entire command had recrossed without molestation, and reached camp at 4 p. m. without loss of a man. A few prisoners were taken and forwarded to the provost-marshal of the corps.

Very respectfully,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
