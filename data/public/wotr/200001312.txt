HEADQUARTERS.

Fort Walla Walla, Wash. Ter., August 9, 1862

SIR: I have the honor to report that at the request of the superintendent of Indian affairs for Oregon and the Indian agent at the Umatilla Reservation, I have directed Captain Currey with twenty men of his company to proceed on a scout of fourteen days toward Grande Ronde Valley. In a personal interview with the gentleman I became convinced that a serious attack had been made upon a settlement that, unless promptly punished, might result in additional and embarrassing hostilities. Inclosed is also transmitted copy of a communication from Mr. Barnhart, and indorsed by Mr. Rector, referring to the subject. The order and letter of instructions to Captain Currey are both respectfully transmitted inclosed for the information of the commanding general of the district, which will explain my action in the matter. The absence of one subaltern of Captain Currey's company on leave of absence, and the attendance of the other on a general court-martial at this post, prevents my sending a commissioned officer at present to the Umatilla Reservation to relieve Lieutenant Hillyer. The sergeant and ten men mentioned in the order will serve all the requirements at the reservation until the re-enforcement arrives.

Trusting that the commanding general will approve this disposition of the detachment referred to, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JUSTUS STEINBERGER,

Colonel First Washington, Territory Infantry, Commanding Post.
