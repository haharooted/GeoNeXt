HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI, Saint Joseph, Mo., April 14, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER,
Macon City, Mo.:

Send a discreet officer with 20 men to Keytesville, Chariton County, to remain there during the session of court, which commences on Monday next. Let them arrive at Keytesville before Monday as if on a scout. I don't want the people to understand that the troops are sent expressly for this purpose. Instruct the officer in command to obtain all information possible touching the condition of affairs in the county. In the mean time he might clean out any gangs of villains that may be in the neighborhood.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
