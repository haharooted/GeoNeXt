HDQRS. NINETIETH REGIMENT NEW YORK VOLS.,
Bayou Boeuf, La., January 20, 1864.

Captain WILLIAM J. DENSLOW,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that 3 of the men of my command absented themselves last night from camp without permission, and had not been heard from until this evening, when a citizen informed me that they had been taken prisoners by a party of rebels near Grass Lake, which is within 6 miles of this station, supposed to be the same party that removed the rails on the road. The citizen who gave the information saw the prisoners and recognized them, they being at the time in the hands of 4 rebel cavalry-men (armed), who stated that they would "be down in a few days and take the rest of them." I sent out a file of mounted men and 1 officer, armed with revolvers, to gain as much information as possible.

On their return the officer reported having been told by one Mr. Rentrop, a citizen, that one of his negroes saw a party of about 15 mounted men pass through his plantation between 10 and 11 o'clock last night, leading several horses and having several dismounted men with them. I have since learned that the 3 missing men borrowed horses from plantations in this vicinity and were seen within 1 mile of the place where the railroad was torn up, about 9 p.m. 19th instant. Four trains have passed this station during the past twenty-four hours, three of them having troops on board en route for Algiers, the other being a special with Assistant Superintendent Green.

I have the honor to be, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. SHAURMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Ninetieth Regiment New York Vols.
