SUMTER, January 5, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report the Ironsides, 4 monitors, 2 wooden gun-boats, 2 mortar-boats, and 15 sailing vessels inside; 5 steamers, 7 schooners, and 1 steam derrick in Light-House Inlet. The latter has always been there, but has not heretofore been specially reported. Ships in the offing not visible; fog last night very thick. Multiplied the sentinels by 10; work going on Morris Island, but apparently not in the way of any change. One of the crew of the guard-boat shot himself through the hand while at the wharf; injured part successfully removed by Major Rhett, surgeon in charge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON.
