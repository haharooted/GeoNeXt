FORT SUMTER, February 23, 1864.

SIR: All quiet and hazy this morning. Two shots hit yesterday. Two of enemy's picket-boats approached within 500 yards last night. If they return to-night I will open with boat howitzer from north berm.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
