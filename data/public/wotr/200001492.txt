CAMP, SIOUX CITY, IOWA, June 1, 1864.

His Excellency WILLIAM M. STONE,

Governor of Iowa:

SIR: A letter I received from General Pope last night informs me that it had been necessary for the War Department to order some of the troops from Minnesota to Arkansas, owing to the late disasters in that State and Louisiana ; and thus the force ordered to meet me from Minnesota must be greatly reduced. And he also proposes, if I think it necessary, to call on you for four or five companies of the new national guard as a protection to the frontier, whereby I will be enabled to take with me most of the troops I intended as a protection to the frontier of Iowa and Dakota.

These troops, if furnished me, would necessarily arrive so late that before that time I would as far up the country: therefore I should be obliged to leave a cavalry force on the frontier before starting. I have no infantry as a guard at different points, and I cannot increase my force by your sending me these troops; but if you could send two companies, to be stationed at Fort Randall, I could send the cavalry I have stationed there out on the James River, where they could do good service in breaking up small encampments of hostile Indians. Should you be able to send them, send me a telegraph informing me when they will start. My troops have mostly left here, and I shall follow in a few days.

With much respect, your obedient servant,

ALF. SULLY,

Brigadier-General.
