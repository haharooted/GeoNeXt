HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,

Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., October 11, 1862.

Honorable A. C. GIBBS,

Governor of Oregon, Salem, Oreg.:

Who are "officers of the line?" The third section of the tenth article of the constitution of Oregon says: "The Governor shall appoint the adjutant-general and the other chief officers of the general staff and his own staff, and all officers of the line shall be elected by the persons subject to military duty in their respective districts. "

My opinion is requested as to the meaning of the term "all officers of the line" in the above paragraph. I understand by this all regimental and company officers, colonels, lieutenant-colonels, majors, captains, first lieutenants, or second lieutenants, either of infantry, cavalry, or artillery. I understand the constitution to confer upon the Governor the appointment of all other officers, that is, the officers of every branch of the staff. (See Colonel H. L. Scott's Military Dictionary, p. 389.) The phrase "officers of the general staff" must include all officers not regimental, including general officers. (See Halleck's Military Act, p. 236, first edition.)

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
