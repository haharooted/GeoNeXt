CINCINNATI, Jun 11, 1864.

(Received 9. 30 a. m.)

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Burbridge appears this morning to be driving Morgan successfully, though he keeps too much in rear to promise capture. There does not appear to be much danger to Sherman's communications or approach to the river. Infantry is of little account except to guard important points. You must change policy in Kentucky. Rebel sympathizers in the State encourage and aid these raids to injure Union citizens. Those parties should be subjected to prompt assessments to cover damages. Nothing put a vigorous application of Maryland policy will save Kentucky, and the longer that is delayed the more dangerous Kentucky becomes. The gun-boat idea is a good one, but light-draft boats must be used in view of low summer water. If the Navy Department cannot furnish them, I think men can be found here to fit out and organize a fleet. My movements for a few days are uncertain. Communications sent to Columbus will be promptly forwarded to me. Will write you.

JNO. BROUGH,

Governor.
