August 10, 1862.

Colonel JOSEPH R. WEST,

First California Volunteer Infantry:

COLONEL: Pursuant to instructions received on the 6th instant we left this place on that day for the Pino Alto mines, taking with us a quantity of provisions for distribution among the inhabitants of that place, represented to be in a starving condition. we arrived there on the 7th, and called upon the principal men of the place to assist us in ascertaining the names, ages, business, condition, number, &c., of the inhabitants. We found about thirty Americans, Franch, Germans, &c., two of the Germans with families. All the rest were Mexicans. Most of them were extremely poor and destitute, there beingscarcely any ore at all in the mines. They had received some little assistance previous to our arrival, before which time they had been living on purslane and roots, and several had become insane from hunger.

Number of families in the mines, two - Mr. Schneider's and Mr. Holtz's; number of Mexican families living in the mines, about thirty, all extremely poor. All the people seemed to be loyally inclined, although several of them had belonged to the Arizona Rangers, a company formed for the purpose of fighting the Indians in the Territory. The Indians were represented as being extremely hostile and in the habit of committing depredations upon the settlers whenever they and in the habit of committing depredations upon the settlers whenever they had anything to steal. At the time of our visit there were no Indians in the neighborhood, but every one thought that as soon as trains with supplies commenced their trips the Indians would begin to commit depredations. All were extremely anxious to have the Government extend to them sufficient protection and station at least one company in their neighborhood.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. SHIRLAND,

Captain, First California Volunteer Cavalry.
