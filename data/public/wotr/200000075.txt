HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,
May 10, 1864-1.50 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Tunnel hill:

Your dispatch directing me to take a strong defensive position before daylight was received about an hour ago. After consulting with my division commanders I am satisfied it is impracticable to withdraw my troops from their present position in the night and get them into position again before daylight. A night movement in such ground cannot be made without inextricable confusion. I see no alternative but to fight where I am in the morning. I will make my flank as strong as possible. If you apprehend a main attack on this flank, can you not send some troops to re-enforce me?

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
