CAMP NELSON, June 11, 1864--11 p. m.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

Every man for whom I have a gun is under arms and on the fortifications. We will do the best we can in case of an attack. We had but few arms and they not of the best quality. Keep me informed of movements of enemy during the night, if you get any information regarding them. Where is General Burbridge; has he left Paris?

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
