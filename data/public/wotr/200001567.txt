[JUNE 12, 1864. - For Sturgis to Washburn, reporting operations, &c., see Part I, pp. 88, 218.] MEMPHIS, June 12, 1864.

(Received 18th.)

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

GENERAL: Brigadier-General Sturgis encountered the enemy, near Guntown, Miss., on the 10th in large force, and met with very serious disaster. His force consisted of 3,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry, and sixteen pieces artillery. He was driven back with great loss.

The enemy had a large force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The cavalry followed up our force to within thirty miles of this city, and it is reported that a large infantry force is moving in this direction. Our loss will reach full 3,000 men, 12 pieces of artillery, and 100 wagons.

The artillery was not lost in battle, but owing to the continued rains for ten days the roads wee so bad as to compel the abandonment of wagons and artillery, first destroying them as much as possible.

I had orders to send out this expedition for some time before I sent it, and delayed because I felt too weak. The last telegrams of General W. T. Sherman and General J. B. McPherson I inclose, from which you will observe that they were both deceived as to the force of the enemy. * I sent a larger force by 2,000 than Major-General Sherman declared necessary. Your dispatch of the 8th received, and your request in regard to boats will be attended to.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
