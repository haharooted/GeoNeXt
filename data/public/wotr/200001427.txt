HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., April 11, 1864.

Colonel PHELPS,

Cassville, Mo.:

You can make such moves as the condition requires when you learn what the condition is. Send out the militia as soon as their condition will permit, but make everything subservient to whipping out the enemy and keeping them south of you.

JOHN A. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
