Major General H. W. HALLECK,
Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 28, directing me to send all the available ocean transportation in this department to New Orleans.

At the time of the receipt of this communication I was engaged in making a demonstration against the enemy, and have employed every steamer available in this department, and they are now actively employed in the same movement. I have not, in fact, a single steamer here suitable for ocean navigation. General Gillmore having taken with him all that were really suited for that purpose.

Two ocean steamers have just entered the harbor form the North, the Harnak and the Star of the South, and I have ordered them to proceed at once to New Orleans.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
