HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES, Port Hudson, La., April 17, 1864.

Major GEORGE B. DRAKE,
Assistant Adjutant -General:

SIR: I regret to be obliged to state that Brigadier-General Andrews is unable to attend to business in consequence of severe indisposition. I am therefore in command of the post. I have the honor to state that pursuant to Field Orders, Numbers 16, extracts 5 and 6, dated headquarters Department of the Gulf, April 11, 1864, I have this day forwarded to Fort Barrancas, Fla., the Eighty-second U. S. Infantry (colored), Colonel Zulavsky, and to Bonnet Carre the Eightieth U. S. Infantry (colored), Colonel Hamlin.

General Andrews desires me to request further instructions as to Field Orders, Numbers 3, dated headquarters Department of the Gulf, March 25, 1864. He suggests that, in view of the fact that the enemy has recently shown himself repeatedly in our neighborhood in considerable strength, it may not be well to further reduce this garrison. Excepting some small fractions of regiments and the cavalry (whose numbers are altogether insufficient for the duty they have to perform), we have now but two regiments of drilled men.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

DANIEL ULLMANN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
