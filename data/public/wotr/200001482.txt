WAR DEPARTMENT,

May 29, 1864-8.30 p.m. (Received 30th.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A telegram of this morning from General Butler giving extracts from the rebel papers as to the retreat of Banks, contains the following suggestion, which is submitted for your directions:

HEADQUARTERS,
May 29, 1864-10.30 a.m.

In view of this news, as the Nineteenth Army Corps is disengaged, I respectfully suggest that it be sent by water to land here or at West Point, in reach of General Grant. General Weitzel, who so well knows the military situation in Louisiana, concurs in the suggestion. It can reach here in fourteen days to re-enforce army depleted by fresh battles to be fought in the mean time.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
