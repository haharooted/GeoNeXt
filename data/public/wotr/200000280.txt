HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
New Orleans, January 28, 1864.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Thirteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires that the generals commanding forces in different portions of Texas shall be instructed to collect beef-cattle whenever practicable, and ship by each returning steamer to New Orleans as many as can be profitably taken on board. This will of course only apply to such steamers as are suitable for transporting cattle. The great scarcity of beef-cattle in this region, and the difficulty of procuring them from the upper Mississippi, make it necessary that great attention should be paid to the duty of collecting such stock at all points where it may be feasible.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
