PORT HUDSON, LA., January 24, 1864

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, New Orleans, La.

The cavalry, under Colonel Fonda, made a reconnaissance yesterday beyond Thompson's Creek to within 5 or 6 miles of Jackson. No enemy in sight. The enemy is, however, reported to have a force at Jackson. Colonel Fonda thinks he will be able to learn definitely about this force in a day or two.
