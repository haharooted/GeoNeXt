HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,
New Orleans, La., January 28, 1864.

Major General W. B FRANKLIN,

Commanding Nineteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: General Dana, is a letter bearing date January 20, 1864, writes me as follows:

There is a Mr. Veazie who belongs, perhaps, to Armstrong's scouts, and who is now in Franklin's camp, who ought to be here. I am informed that he is not a useful man in Louisiana, but would be very useful here. Will you be good enough to procure and forward him to me?

Could you comply with General Dana's request, and oblige, your obedient servant,

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General of Vols., Commanding Thirteenth Army Corps.
