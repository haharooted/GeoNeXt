Major PICKETT.

Numbers 16. Report of Colonel John Taylor Wood, C. S. Army.

RICHMOND, February 8, 1864.

GENERAL: I report to you the result of the late operations near New Berne.

Leaving Kinston at noon on the 31st ultimo, we reached New

Berne at 4 a. m. ; passed down and up in front of the town without discovering the gun-boats. A thick for shut in everything. At daybreak returned up the river to Batchelder's Creek, as our forces were crossing.

Monday, reconnoitered; only one gun-boat in sight. After dark attacked and captured her. She was moored close in shore in order to rake the approaches on the right of their line. I tried to move her, but failed. Her fires were nearly out, and in attempting to tow her out were subjected to a fire of artillery and infantry. Fired her, bringing off all our boats and men.

The next morning all of our forces were ordered back. The water front of the town I found open and unguarded. As far as I could judge, their force was small, say 4,000 men. I will press forward to completion the gun-boats. I think they can be ready for service in a month or six weeks.

Respectfully, &c., your obedient servant,

J. TAYLOR WOOD.
