HDQRS. DISTRICT OF NORTHEASTERN ARKANSAS,
Batesville, Ark., January 18, 1864

Captain CASTLE,

Commanding Detachment Eleventh Missouri Cavalry on the South Bank of White Bear,near Batesville, Ark:

CAPTAIN: You will proceed immediately with 75 men, properly officered, armed, and equipped with three days' rations, to the Grand Glaize, about 18 miles below Jacksonport, on the west side of the river, you will kill every armed rebel you meet with who is clothed in Federal uniform, and shoot all bushwhackers. Take only those men who are really Confederate soldiers as prisoners. Scout around the Glaize until the steamer in charge of District Quartermaster Thompson has passed that point safely, and then return to this place without delay. The protection of the boat will be paramount to everything else, and the colonel commanding relies upon your good sense and judgment to bring this expedition to a favorable termination. Be sure to guard against surprise. Should your rations give out, you will live off the country, giving receipts for all you take, and ordering the parties to whom receipts are given to report with them at these headquarters for payment. You will press a guide at any house you may come to. If he plays you false, shoot him. Take a guidon, that you may make yourself known when the boat passes.

By order of Colonel R. R. Livingston, First Nebraska Cavalry, commanding district:

H. C. FILLEBROWN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
