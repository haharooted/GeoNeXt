May 10, 1864-10 o'clock.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have withdrawn a brigade with I had in the gorge behind you, in order to complete my line on top of the ridge. My regiments are spaced at intervals on the ridge, and it requires all my force. You might connect by a strong picket-line with my left regiment.

J. NEWTON,

Brigadier-General.
