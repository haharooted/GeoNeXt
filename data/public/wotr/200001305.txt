Reports of Captain George B. Currey, First Oregon Cavalry.

GRANDE RONDE, August 15, 1862

SIR: On the second day from Umatilla Agency I surprised Tenounis' (the Dreamer) camp, about 1 o'clock at night. Held a long talk with him, endeavoring to induce him to go with me to Walla Walla, Wash. Ter. This he obstinately refused. I gave him until 8 a. m. to consider in. At the expiration of that time he told me that if the tyee at Walla Walla wished to see him he might come, but that he would not go . I then concluded to make him a prisoner. This he resisted, firing at me twice. I shot him with a revolver, as well as one of his principal men. While this was going on several shots were fired among my men from a crowd of some fifteen or twenty Indias, whom I had supposed to be mere spectators. One fire from my men's yagers sent them out of sight except two, who fell. The Indians claim that the two shot by the men were friendly Indians. This may create some dissatisfaction among those on the reserve. I shall remain here a day or two to recruit my horses and watch the shape things are taking.

Yours, respectfully,

GEO. B. CURREY,

Captain, First Cavalry Oregon Volunteers.

Commanding OFFICER AT FORT WALLA WALLA, WASH. TER.
