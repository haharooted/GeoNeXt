GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 25th instant, 9 p. m.

I will be glad to know your wishes in this respect and if recent events since your arrival at Camp Lapwai will make any change advisable. Forage has been distributed on the road to Lewiston, and a rapid march can be made hence and returning. Lieutenant-Colonel Maury is expected on the 28th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUSTUS STEINBERGER,
