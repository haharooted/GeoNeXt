HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,
Forth Levenworth, January 25, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

A. A. G., War Department, Adjutant-General's Office:

COLONEL: I have the honor respectfully to request that the order assigning Major John W. Noble, Third Iowa Cavalry, to duty in this

department be rescinded. This regiment is ordered to Iowa, having re-enlisted as veterans, and Major Noble desires to aid in its reorganization. As his promotion in the regiment depends somewhat on claims upon his services, and would be glad if you would issue the necessary order to restore him to his regiment again.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
