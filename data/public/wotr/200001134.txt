Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., October 4, 1862.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Hdqrs. Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: By your letter of instructions of the 11th of July quarters at Fort Walla Walla for four companies of Oregon cavalry and two companies of infantry were directed to be placed in readiness. There are five companies of Oregon cavalry in that vicinity. Unles I receive orders from your office to the contrary I propose to order one of those companies after they reach Fort Walla Walla on the 1st of November to take post at Fort Dallas. Preparations for it have been made at that post. I shall probably order Major Rinearson, of First Oregon Volunteer Cavalry, to command at that post, the company under his command at Camp Lapwai, near Lewiston, accompanying him thither. The Nez Perce Indians near his camp are very restive under the occupation of their reservation by the whites. There are many dissatisfied spirits among them, under Eagle of the Light. Congress having appropriated $40,000 to enable the Indian Department to extinguish the Indian title to a portion or to the whole of the reservation, the hope is entertained that some satisfactory arrangement may eventually be made with that tribe. Major Rinearson appears to have made strenuous efforts, but with little sucess, to break up the sale of liquor to the Indians. The chiefs have a very creditable desire to prevent the traffic.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
