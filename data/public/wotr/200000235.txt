Harrisonburg, La., March 4, 1864.

MAJOR: One gun-boat is reported aground at the mouth of Little River. The other five are just below the mouth of that river. Captain Randle, commanding the cavalry, did not report to me punctually, and I was only notified this morning, and I am moving two regiments back to Trinity. The road is almost impassable. I cannot move any artillery over it. My troops are very much worn out and deficient in rations. I will do my best.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. J. POLIGNAC,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major L. BUSH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

If I was provided with some incendiary matter I might try to burn their fleet. The distance between Trinity and Harrisonburg and the miserable condition of the road makes it a very heavy duty on me to oppose the enemy at both places.
