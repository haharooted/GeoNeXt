CHARLESTON, May 23, 1864.

The enemy landed some four or five regiments yesterday morning on James Island, and made a demonstration on our works. They were checked and repulsed, and have retired. * * * But to do it I had to detain one day the Twentieth South Carolina Regiment and two battalions of Florida infantry. They will go on now without delay. The Twentieth South Carolina and Florida battalions were on the point of taking the cars for Virginia. I think it fortunate that I had an opportunity of exhibiting their strength with only one day's delay.
