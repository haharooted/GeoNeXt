Major General A. J. SMITH:

GENERAL: I have this moment received bad news from General Sturgis. He has met with serious disaster, and needs help; he is falling back, hardly pressed. Please order 2,000 infantry to be at the railroad station with three days' rations, as early as possible this morning. They should take 100 rounds ammunition. The case is urgent.

Respectfully, yours,
C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
