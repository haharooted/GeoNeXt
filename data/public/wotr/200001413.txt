CLARKSVILLE, ARK., April 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General KIMBALL:

Three hundred of these guerrillas are men collected from the south of the river, from Franklin, Carroll, and Newton Counties; 100 are in small bands scattered over this country and Pope. Every available horse, mule, and ox has been pressed, by order of Colonel Judson, to haul cotton from Roseville. I am doing all I can with the force I have. I sent out Lieutenant Roseman last night. He was to have sent me a dispatch before this time, but have not heard from him, and fear that he is captured or driven the other way.

G. M. WAUGH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
