HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,
Hilton Head, S. C., June 13, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Armies of the U. S., Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit herewith, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Rear-Admiral J. A. Dahlgren, commanding South Atlantic Blockade Squadron, showing that since the capture of the Water Witch the weakness of the squadron has caused the admiral to withdraw from the inside blockade of many of the sounds and rivers in the department.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
