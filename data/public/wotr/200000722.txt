HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,
Saint Louis, Mo., May 31, 1864

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Springfield, Mo.:

Colonel Catherwood says you have a large number of muskets in store at Springfield in the arsenal in town. It seems to me it would be prudent at once to provide a place for them inside Fort Numbers 1. Report by telegraph the number of such arms, and any other information you may think worth communicating.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
