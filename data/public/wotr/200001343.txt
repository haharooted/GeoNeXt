Numbers 1. Report of Brigadier General Benjamin F. Kelly, U. S. Army.

CUMBERLAND, MD., February 12, 1864. (Received 8. 45 p. m.)

The express train west last night was thrown off the track near Kearneysville by a hand of Gilmor's guerrillas, numbering about 25. They did not burn the train or take away any prisoners, but robbed the conduct and passengers of quite a sum of money. Brigadier-General Sullivan reports his cavalry in pursuit. General Duffie reports his cavalry had captured a portion of the guerrilla force that took General Scammon, but does not say that the general is recaptured.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
