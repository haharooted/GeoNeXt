LEXINGTON, KY., June 12, 1864-3. 50 p. m.

General H. B. CARRINGTON,

Louisville, Ky.:

My last advices, direct from General Burbridge, were to the effect that he would attack Morgan, at Cynthiana, at daybreak to-day. The Cincinnati operator says courier just brought report to Boyd's Station that Hobson surrendered his command to superior numbers yesterday. General Burbridge came up with Morgan this morning near Cynthiana, and, after an hour's fight, completely broke him up. Am expecting courier from General Burbridge. Will inform you at once on his arrival.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
