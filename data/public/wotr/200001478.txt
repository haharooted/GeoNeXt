ROLLA, MO., May 29, 1864

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following information has just been received from General Sanborn:

Shelby has not appeared north of the Boston Mountains. Jackman designs getting the remainder of his force north by moving in small bodies up the route by the California House, and it is probable that it was a portion of his force that passed there on the 27th. He does not and will not approach any posts. There is no disturbance in the district.

I forward this for the information of the commanding general of the department and of the District of North Missouri.

J. RAINSFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
