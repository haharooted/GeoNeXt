MILWAUKEE, WIS., June 2, 1864.

General SIBLEY,

Saint Paul, Minn.:

I know of nothing to prevent your leaving for the frontier to-morrow. Be careful, however, to leave detailed instructions for the disposition of the companies of the Thirtieth Wisconsin, which will reach Saint Paul in a day or two.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
