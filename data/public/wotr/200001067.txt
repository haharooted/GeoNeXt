MEMPHIS, June 12, 1864.

(Via Cairo 14th. Received 10. 50 a. m. 14th.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington:

Brigadier-General Sturgis, with a force of 3,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry, and sixteen pieces of artillery, met General Forrest, on the 10th instant, near Guntown, Miss., in large force of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. The fight was very severe, and loss in killed and wounded very severe, and our troops completely worsted, losing most of the infantry and artillery. Sturgis' rear was at Collierville the last accounts, with the enemy pursuing. The loss will no doubt reach 2,000 to 4,000 men. With troops lately arrived I am safe here. The move into MISSISSIPPI was under the orders of Major-General McPherson. June 1 he telegraphed me from Dallas, Ga., as follows, viz:

Now is the time to move into Northern MISSISSIPPI against Columbus and other points generally, and smash things. We know that nearly the whole moving force which was formerly in MISSISSIPPI and Tennessee is up here; has been re-enforced against us.

Major-General Sherman telegraphed me in regard to this move as follows, viz:

The command need not exceed 6,000 men as I know that all of Polk's troops are with Johnston, and Forrest is on his way here.

I sent over 8,000 men under the command of an officer sent me by General Sherman.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
