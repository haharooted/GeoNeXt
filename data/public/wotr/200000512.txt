Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Please send General Hunter to report to me. From the last dispatches from Major-General Banks, I fear he is going to be late in his spring movement, and I am desirous of sending and officer of rank with duplicates of his orders, and with further instructions.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
