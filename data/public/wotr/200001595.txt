LEWISTON, October 11, 1862.

Colonel STEINBERGER,

Walla Walla:

SIR: At a meeting held in this town a short time since the citizens drew up a series of resolutions and also a memorial, which they have forwarded to His Excellency Governor Pickering, requesting or urging upon him the necessity of continuing the troops now at Lapwai at or near Lewiston during the ensuing winter; also for an additional force of 200 muskets with which to protect themselves in case of need, as it is greatly feared that there will be an outbreak among the Indians. They have commenced to show signs of hostility already, and I am authorized by them to notify you of the facts. Anything that you can do in this matter to aid us in getting the necessary force or arms will be kindly remembered by our citizens.

Your most obedient servant,

R. BAILEY,

Secretary.
