SUMTER, January 12, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the thick weather will not permit an observation of the fleet this morning. I was unable to discover the fourth monitor yesterday. A quantity of old iron was shipped by the steamer last night; a 42-pounder lies ready for shipment when the flat shall be sent.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
