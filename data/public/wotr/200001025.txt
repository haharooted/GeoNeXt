CHARLESTON, S. C., July 1, 1864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Commanding Dept. of the South, Hilton Head, S. C.:

GENERAL: The journals of this morning inform us, for the first time, that 5 general officers of the Confederate service have arrived at Hilton Head, with a view to their being subjected to the same treatment that we are received here. We think it is just to ask these officers every kindness and courtesy that you can extend to them, in acknowledgment of the fact that we, at this time, are as pleasantly and comfortably situated as is possible for prisoners of war, receiving from the Confederate authorities every privilege that we could desire or except, nor are we unnecessarily exposed to fire.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

H. W . WESSELLS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers,

T. SEYMOUR,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers,

E. P. SCAMMON,

Brigadier-General,

C. A. HECKMAN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers,

ALEXANDER SHALER,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers,

Prisoners of War.
