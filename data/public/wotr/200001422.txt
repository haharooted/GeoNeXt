HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES ON THE RIO GRANDE, Brownsville, Tes., April 16, 1864.

Major General J. A. McCLERNAND,

Commanding Thirteenth Corps:

GENERAL: I can hardly express the regear I felt at being unable to see you while here and confer with you in regard to matters of importance connected with thais command. In visiting the different portions of the town with the surgeon-in-chief, to make arrangements for small-pox patients and to prevent the spread of that disease among our soldiers and the citizens, I undertunately caught the disease myself, and was confined almost three weeks to bed with the variouloid. At present I am feeling quite well, although not as strong as I could wish. Your letter of the 7th instant was haded me, and I thank you for the complimentary manner in which my troops and the various departments are spoken of.

The regiments composing my division have all been with me for the past two years, and are among the best troops in the service. I have seen them tried and can assure you they will bring no discredit upon the corps. It is the first time they have received encouragement (except from myself) since in this department. Your kind words were fully appreciated. In regard to the fortification s, our relations with the authorities on the others side, and many other matters of importance, I will say nothing until I see you personally, which I shall endeavor to do within the next two weeks. There is nothing late from the interior of Texas or Mexico. A general rumor prevails that Colonel Ford will attack this place, but I consider it an impossibility. Brigadier-General Benton has arrived and been assigned to duty. Let me assure you, general, that although as a division we have not before served under you, yet we hail your return to the command of the corps with as much pleasure and delight as any of your old troops.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General.
