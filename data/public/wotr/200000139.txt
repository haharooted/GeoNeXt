BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

SECRETARY OF WAR.

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,
Fort Monroe, February 12, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward to you with commendation the report* of Brigadier-General Wistar of his brilliantly and ably executed movement upon Richmond, which failed only from one of those fortuitous circumstances against which no foresight can provide and no execution can overcome.

By the corruption and faithlessness of a sentinel, who is now being tried for the offense, a man condemned to death, but reprieved by the President, was allowed to escape within the enemy's lines, and there gave them such information as enabled them to meet our advance. This fact is acknowledged in two of the Richmond papers, the Examiner and the Sentinel, published the day after the attack, and is fully confirmed by the testimony before the court-martial, before which is being tried the man who permitted the escape. I beg leave to call your attention to the suggestion of General Wistar in his report, that the effect of the raid will be to hereafter keep as many troops around Richmond for its defense from any future movement of the Army of the Potomac as we have in this neighborhood.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

BEJN. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
