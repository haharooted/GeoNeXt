LEXINGTON, KY., June 12, 1864-11. 40 a. m.

Captain G. H. LAIRD,

Falmouth, Ky., via Louisville:

General Burbridge expects to strike Morgan at or near Cynthiana this morning. I have telegraphed General Heitzelman to send re- enforcements from Covington. The six guns and 300 men at Falmouth better await the arrival of more troops before pushing on. Send out scouts; ascertain if Burbridge is fighting; if so, do all you can to have a force pushed against Morgan's rear at once.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
