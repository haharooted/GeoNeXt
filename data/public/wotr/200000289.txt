Captain CAMERON,

Commanding at Cassville, Mo.:

All the mounted force now at Cassville, except sufficient to do the escort duty for the trains and guard the section of artillery, will be moved forward toward Berryville until it can obtain forage for the animals, and will report to General Holland; and if all the forces under him are not needed the detachment of the Eleventh Missouri Cavalry will be ordered to this place. Of the two squadrons of Enrolled Missouri Militia, one may be sent to Keatsville.
