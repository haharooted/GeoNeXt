EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Salem, Oreg., October 7, 1862.

General B. ALVORD:

DEAR SIR: The Legislature has under consideration a militia law; and there is a question under our constitution as to what officers are to be appointed by the Governor and which are elective. The question arises as to which are "the chief officers of the general staff" and which are "officers of the line. " Herewith I send you a copy of our constitution* and call your attention to sections 3 and 4, article 10. Who are "officers of the line?" Where is the distinction between "line" and 'staff?" There is a difference of opinion here. If our constitution means anything I presume you are perfectly familiar with the rule that should govern, and you will place me under renewed obligations by giving me information upon these points at your earliest convenience. Any general suggestions you may be pleased to make on the organization of the militia will be gratefully received. Doctor McBride has just returned from the Powder River mines, and he told me this morning that, in his opinion, there will be trouble with the Indians in that vicinity; that the Indians had informed the miners that they might dig gold, but must not take their lands.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ADDISON C. GIBBS,

Governor of Oregon.
