FRANKLIN, LA., January 30, 1864-11.40 a. m.

(Received 11.45 a. m.)

Brigadier General C. P. STONE, Chief of Staff:

I sent a staff officer yesterday to get an answer to a note of Colonel Dwight to Major Levy, of General Taylor's staff. He met a scouting party of the enemy about 15 miles out. In conversation with the men it was apparent that the Second Louisiana Cavalry (rebel) is the only force between here and Vermillion. The rebel force referred to by Colonel Molineux is doubtless Captain Murphy's independent company, which has been conscripting in the vicinity of Faussee Pointe. Is it the intention of the major-general commanding that I shall remain here in command of this post? I ask this because if such is his intention, I wish to make my personal arrangements accordingly.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General Commanding.
