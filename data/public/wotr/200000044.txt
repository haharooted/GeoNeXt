Rocky Face, May 9, 1864-8.45 p. m.

Major-General STONEMAN, Charleston:

Do not move to-night. Start early in the morning and move to Varnell's Station. Orders will be there for you. Grant has whipped Lee for three days, driving him ten miles the last day. Lee left dead and wounded on the field. Everything here going well, but we need your help very much.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
