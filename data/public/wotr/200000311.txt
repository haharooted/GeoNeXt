HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,
Matagorda Peninsula, Tex., January 28, 1864.

Brigadier General W. P. BENTON,

Commanding Post at Indianola:

You will be very careful to provide against any attack by water on such transports as may at any time be lying at or near your wharf, and will keep your troops well on the alert and some of your artillery properly disposed with that purpose. You will see that the transports, whilst they are there, have their guns and their crews constantly ready for action, and will always, at such times, keep at least 100 men on guard on or in the vicinity of the transports, ready instantly to repel a boat attack.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
