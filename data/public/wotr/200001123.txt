ROUND VALLEY, September 25, 1862.

Honorable G. M. HANSON:

SIR: It becomes my duty to inform you that the whole of the Con Cow and Hat Creek tribes of Indians pulled up stakes yesterday evening and left. The settlers have succeeded in destroying a large portion of the crops of small grain and the entire crop of corn (over 100 acres). We have found as high as seven slip gaps of one morning, where they had raised up the corners of the fence, put in chunks and slipped out the rails, until the largest hogs could walk in. And when they had destroyed the crops, they then told the Indians there was nothing for them to east, that they would have to starve or steal, and if they did not leave they would kill them. There were quite a number of the settlers came in about the time they left, I suppose, to see that all went off right. I did not attempt to prevent them by force, for I knew it would be useless, as I could do nothing alone, when every person in the valley was doing all they could do to put them off. Old Reese, after my feeding him all the winter, came here and told the Indians "to leave and go back to their homes, that there was no reservation any longer; that it had gone in. " Several of the citizens went up and spent the first night with the Indians on Eel River as they journeyed on. On their return, some brought their squaws back with them, &c. Smith told the Pitt River Indians if they did not leave inside of three days they would all be killed. Some talk of leaving; others say they will stay and risk it, &c.
