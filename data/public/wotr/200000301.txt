Kansas City, Mo., January 27, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Commanding Dept. of Kansas, Fort Leavenworth:

GENERAL: Colonel Ford, Second Colorado, arrived here to-day with three companies of his regiment. He left the other companies, armed only with sabers, at Dresden, to await there the receipt of arms which wee shipped from New York recently to Colonel Callender of them. No intelligence has yet been received by him of the arrival of the arms at Saint Louis, through he confidently expects they have been received and forwarded by Colonel Callender by this date.

Until the remaining companies arrive here, Colonel Ford cannot relieve all the Kansas troops in the border counties of Missouri; and until they are all relieved I cannot report to you under existing orders. Thinking it probable you wish to have me report to you at an early day, I suggest that, if you wish to have me report to you at an early day, I suggest that, if you wish it, I apply for orders to turn my command over to Colonel Ford at once. If you wish me to do so, please advise me by telegraph or to otherwise. General Brown's order has already been issued, assuming command of these counties, and placing Colonel Ford in immediately command of them. The order, of course, is at present inoperative.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
