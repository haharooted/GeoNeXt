HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,
Tunnel Hill, Ga., May 9, 1864-3.30 p. m.

General GARRARD,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The dispatch of General Corse has been received,* and I am directed by the general commanding to say to you at all events to keep up with the infantry, if possible. There is not, nor has been, any enemy at La Fayette. It has been patrolled by 400 men for you, and he desires you to hurry to General McPherson. I will add for myself as official that General Grant drove Lee from every position on the 5th and 6th, and on the 7th pursued him ten miles, capturing all his wounded.

I am, with much regard, yours, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
