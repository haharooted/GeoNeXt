HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,
Fort Humboldt, September 17, 1862.

COLONEL: I have the honor to transmit herewith the official reports of Lieutenant-Colonel Olney and Lieutenant Noyes relative to the unfortunate affair of the 8th instant on Redwood Creek. On the 14th instant I delivered over all the Indian prisoners at this post, 834 in number, to Mr. Hanson, Jr. son of the Indian superintendent on the written order of his father, who remained at Crescent City. Among these were the noted chiefs of predatory bands, Las-Sic, Say-Winne, and Claw-Foot, with many of their followers. They left in the steamer Panama the same day for Crescent City, together with Captain O'Brien's company (C), Second California Volunteer Infantry.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,

Colonel Second California Vol. Infty., Commanding Humboldt Mil. Dist.
