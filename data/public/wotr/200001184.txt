EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Olympia, Wash. Ter., October 21, 1862.

Major General GEORGE WRIGHT,

Commanding Pacific Military Department, San Francisco, Cal.:

DEAR SIR: Notwithstanding all your careful vigilance in providing military protection for the overland emigrants, and notwithstanding the prompt manner in which Colonel Justus Steinberger carried your orders into execution for that purpose, together with General Alvord's hearty concurrence and support of all your plans and directions given to dispose of the troops under your command in this Territory in the most advisable manner, so as to render the most efficient protection to the whole populatin of emigrants coming on the overland road from the States to this Pacific region, yet with all this care and pains thus taken by yourself, by General Benj. Alvord, and by Colonel Steinberger, with which I have felt so well pleased and for which yourself, Alvord, and Steinberger have so well merited and deserved not only my sincere thanks, but the thanks, the confidence, and the good will of the whole community, and yet, sir, after all has thus been done that could be done to afford protection to the lives and proeprty of our overland emigrants, Judge Hewitt informs me that from the most reliable statements he has received he has reasons for believing that a large number of emigrants have been robbed and murdered along the Snake River road during this season than in any previous year. This terrible human butchery of our own white American population of men, women, and children is too horrible a picture to think of, to look at, to reflect upon, or to record in the history of the manner in which settlers have had to come to this country, in constant jeopardy of losing their lives and property, and numbers have been thus sacrificed in their efforts to get here. We cannot bear to hear this tale of accursed cruelty told without every feeling of sympathy being aroused, of sorrow and pity for the sufferers and all their familyr friends and acquaintances; not can we think of those flagrant outrages without every sense of justice and every feeling of our hearts and souls being roused tot he highest pitch of resolute indignation against these foul and atrocious murderers and robbers. My dear sir, it is enough to make us all instantly raise our hands and our voices and swear by all that is sacred in heaven and on earth that the avenging hand of public justice shall be swiftly, yes, immediately stretched out to deal energetic and proper punishment upon all those fiends in human form who have been guilty of these recent as well as lal former murders and robberies on these emigrant roads for all time past since these roads have been traveled by the Pacific Coast emigration.

General Wright, in the name and on the behalf of the population of this Territory, I want instant and immediate retributive justice done in these cases of brutal murders and robberies that have been so lately inflicted upon our own innocent, peaceable, and unoffending fellow-citizens while they were quietly traveling from the Valley of the Mississippi to the Pacific States and Territories. And expressly for this purpose, I now most earnestly, respectfully, and urgently beg and request that you will immediately decide upn the most practicable plan of dealing out the proper mesure of punishment upon each and every one of these monsters in atrocity who have been guilty of all these foul crimes against the just laws of God and man; against the lives and property of our fellow-citizens. And I pray you do not delay nor weaken the blow of inflicting punishment by procrastinating the time of action for ten, nor five, nor four, three, two, nor one year after the perpetration of these crimes against humanity, but strike quickly, and I pray you strike now, while the hands of these villainous murderers are yet reeking and red with the blood of their innocent and unoffending victims; for if your effeort be left until next spring before you begin the work of preparation to ythen send troops in warm sun-shining weather to catch these vicious murderes, long ebefore our troops can reach that bloody ground the white and red skinned demons who have murderously assassinated or own peaceable fellow-citizens will by that time have safely gotten out of the reach of all who may then be sent, entirely too late to catch the guilty men; it will then be, as it has always been, a mere farce. To effectively punish the guilty and strike terror into the hearts of all others, as a lasting warning, and to give positive and enduring proof that their crimes shall not go long unpunished, it is absolutely necessary that troops should be sent at least as far on the road up Snake River as Fort Boise, or perhaps still farther, and with plenty of provisions with them, there to winter, if they could get no farther (with safety) toward Salmon Falls, where it is thought the Snake River Indians and their white associates reside during winter. And the protection of our scattered mining population will need two or three new military stations being immediately established as far southward and eastward as Fort Boise. Therefore, with these views of the necessity of immediate action being taken by the troops under your command, in order to inflict a lastingly righteous punishment upon the murdering and plundering Snake River Indians and their associates in crime, and for the further purpose of affording suitable and necessary protection to our newly settled farming and mining population now going to winter on both sides of the Snake River Valley, I respectfully request you will authorize and direct General B. Alvord to establish a military post at Fort Boise, and another half way between that place and Lewiston, with plenty of provisions to sustain the troops through the winter and spring months, and for all our forces to be directed to reach the Salmon Falls and Fort Hall at the earliest day practicable to punish the murderers and robbers of our citizens.

With great respect, &c., your obedient servant,

WILLIAM PICKERING,

Governor of Washington Territory.
