[Second indorsement.]

HEADQUARTERS HILTON HEAD DISTRICT, Hilton Head, S. C., July 29,1 864.

Respectfully returned to the major-general commanding, and his attention is invited to the accompanying report* of Captain Pickering, acting assistant inspector-general.

The return of the armed transports to Scull Creek would seem to be the only method of increasing security form attack along the shores of that stream, as Captain Pickering observes. With the small force at our disposal, it is impossible to furnish a complete chain of pickets for the whole distance.

EDWARD E. POTTER,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
