SUMTER, January 4, 1864-12.45 p. m.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the boom in front of the sea and eastern portions of the gorge faces was successfully laid last night, and that it remains in position. I think that an addition to its length of both extremities would be an improvement. While the work of laying was going on Fort Johnson fired 3 shots in this direction; fortunately no harm was done. I understand that the sentinel though he saw and heard musketry at this post. As we had two steamers and a feet of small boats here, the risk to property was very great. The batteries being near the telegraph office, I was able to check it before our range had been attained. I recommend that Fort Johnson be no longer included among our supporting batteries. The distance is too great and the required adjustment of aim too nice for good results to be attained, and the probability is that the effect upon the garrison will be more injurious than upon the enemy. The difficulty is not owing to nay defect in the skill of our artillerists, but belongs to the nature of the case.

At 4.20 a. m. this morning the alarm signal was made by the navy guard-boat, which afterward reported two small boats and a monitor approaching. The parapet had been manned, and was kept so until daylight, as the night was peculiarly favorable to an assault. No observation this morning. Weather thick.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
