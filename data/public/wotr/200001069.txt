Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Operator at Bagdad reports removed cannonading toward Frankfort. The regiment of cavalry form here that left Bagdad twenty-four hours ago has not been heard from, though ordered to report at once by messenger to Bagdad. Please advise in what direction General Burbridge is pursuing Morgan; it may prove important. There are several detached bands not far from Frankfort.

HENRY B. CARRINGTON,

Brigadier-General.
