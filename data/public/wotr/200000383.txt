I. Regulations will be established on the 1st of February proximo for the government of persons employed in plantation labor during the present year. All parties interested therein will have an opportunity to present their views upon this subject to the commission of enrollment, the object being to secure a reliable, economical, and just system of compensated labor.

II. All plantations not in process of cultivation on the 1st day of February proximo, unless excepted from the operation of this order for special reasons, will be considered abandoned estates, and rented by the Government to such persons as will undertake their proper cultivation.

III. Consideration of public health require the suspension of all unnecessary communication or travel by plantation laborers between the different parishes of the State, or between plantations of the same parish. Such communication or travel, therefore, is forbidden, except under regulations established by the provost-marshals of the several parishes, and upon passes issued in accordance therewith. Public officers and managers of estates are requested to assist in the execution of this order.
