HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, October 25, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith communications from Brigadier General B. Alvord, commanding the District of Oregon, dated, respectively, on the 14th and 15th instant. * In the general's letter of the 14th of October he has frequently referred to the policy which I recommended to the War Department when I was in command of the Department of Oregon in 1860, and which, but for the breaking out of the rebellion, would doubtless have been carried out with beneficial effects. I most cordially approve of all the recommendations of General Alvord, especially as to the establishment of a post at or near old Fort Boise, and the arrangement of a system of escorts for the protection of the large and annually increasing number of emigrants arriving from the east.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
