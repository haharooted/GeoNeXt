FORT SUMTER, February 1,1 864.

I have the honor to report that the firing was discontinued last night. A steamer and schooner discharged full cargoes of sand. An alarm was caused by the firing of a musket to seaward of the fort. The parapet was manned very satisfactorily.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
