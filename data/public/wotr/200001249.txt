HDQRS. FOURTH INFANTRY CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS,
Camp Latham, July 14, 1862.

Major R. C. Drum,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to inclose a copy of a report of Lieutenant-Colonel Evans in relation to the Owen's River Expedition. Major O'Neill has reported to me, and Captain McLaughlin, of the same command, has just arrived from Fort Yuma. The command of Major O'Neill, consisting of the cavalry fit for duty in camp and those brought up by Captain McLaughlin, will number twenty-five men. They will be dispatched to Owen's River so soon as the horses from Fort Yuma are fit to travel, which will be but a few days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. FORMAN,

Colonel Fourth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding Post.
