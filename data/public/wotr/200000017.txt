General McCOOK:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires you to move to-morrow morning at daylight down the road from Varnell's Station to Dalton, to discover any movement the enemy may make on our left. If you find that the enemy is moving to attack our flank, you will at once attack vigorously, so as to develop the movements and designs of the enemy as far as possible.

Very respectfully, your possible servant,

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
