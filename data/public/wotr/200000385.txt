HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 27, 1864.

Captain CAMERON,

Commanding at Cassville, Mo.:

Your commissary train should be in to-day with 12,000 rations. The troops sent from here have all six days' rations. I think if the troops remain in that vicinity to operate, I will send down a commissary train. Have you any word from Berryville since the 25th" If so, have the enemy remained stationary or advanced or retreated?

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
