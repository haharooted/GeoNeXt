HDQRS. FOURTH SUB-DISTRICT, DIST. OF CENTRAL MO.,
Kansas City, Mo., January 29, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Commanding District of Central Missouri:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that pursuant to instructions from you I left Sedalia on Thursday, the 21st instant, with three squadrons of my regiment for this place; arrived here on Wednesday, the 27th. General Ewing will turn over the command to me as soon as I can relieve the Kansas troops. I have ordered Colonel Dodd to send two squadrons directs from Sedalia to Bates County, two to Harrisonville, one to Pleasant Hill. I shall post two squadrons at Independence, one at Hickaman Mills, one at Westport, and three at this post. I find that I am going to be very scarce of transportation, as General Ewing will probably take most of his transportation as infantry, and would respectfully ask that horses may be obtained for them as soon as possible. It is necessary that they all be mounted and drilling. I shall take a complete tour through my sub-district as soon as I take command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. H. FORD,

2nd Colo. Vol. Cav., Commanding 4th Sub-Dist., Central Dist. of Mo.
