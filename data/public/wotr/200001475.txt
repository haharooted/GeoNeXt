LITTLE ROCK, May 30, 1864

Colonel A. H. RAYN,

Cadron Ferry:

The district commander wishes you to occupy Lewisburg whenever you can, but not Dardanelle. Hereafter you will report direct to General Carr. The state of your subsistence supplies should command your attention.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
