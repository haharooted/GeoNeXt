HEADQUARTERS,
Fort Crook, October 5, 1862.

Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, San Francisco:

COLONEL: I arrived at the post with my command to-day by the way of Big Meadows. On my arrival at that place I received information that the party who went in pursuit of the Indians who committed the depredation in Mountain Meadows had returned, having trailed the Indians to the vicinity of Eagle Lake and killing 2 and taking 2 prisoners. Came down the Lawson trail to the Honey Lake emigrant road. Met several trains, the members of which reported no trouble since leaving Humboldt. I left two non-commissioned officers and six men to patrol the road between Honey Lake and Hot Creek Station, as they only difficulty to be apprehended in that neighborhood would be of those Indians stampeding the cattle of small parties, and that force would, I think, be sufficient for that duty. It having been reported that a band of Indians had assembled on Canon Creek, some thiryt miles to the southeast, I sent a scout in that direction, whom I expect to return in three days, when, if necessary, I shall proceed in that direction. During my absence one Bailey, from Oregon, whose brother was killed in Big Valley last year, came here to get his remains, and while in the valley killed three squaws, which may result in giving me some trouble. The Indian guide, Pugh, has several trusty natives under his control, and employs them in hunting the hiding places of the neighboring tribes, and through them I shall endeavor to keep myself posted as to their movements. The trouble reported at Mountain Meadows amounted to killing one man by a party of Eagle Lake Indians, the pursuit of whom was ended on my arrival in the vicinity. My provisions being exhausted, I was obliged to return, but shall again go out on receiving the necessary information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY B. MELLEN,

Captain, Commanding.
