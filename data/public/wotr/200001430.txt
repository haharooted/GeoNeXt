HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,
Saint Louis, Mo., April 9, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

Dispatch received ordering Ninth Iowa Cavalry to Little Rock, Ark. If it is not urgently necessary to send them at once, I recommend a delay of a few days to enable board of examination to finish the examination of the officers. The regiment came here perfectly new, and has been kept here for discipline, drill, and to get rid of incompetent officers.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
