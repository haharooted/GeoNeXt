Numbers 8. Report of Colonel Henry W. Hudson, Eighty-second New York Infantry.

HDQRS. 82nd REGIMENT NEW YORK STATE VOLS.,
Camp near Stevensburg, Va., February 8, 1864.

SIR: In obedience to orders from brigade headquarters, I most respectfully submit the following report of the part this regiment has taken in the recent operations on the Rapidan River:

On the morning of February 6, 1864, left camp near Stevensburg, in line with First Brigade, Second Division, Second Army Corps, and proceeded to Morton's Ford, arriving in vicinity of the ford about 11 a. m., forming in line of battle on the Raccoon Ford road, then marching en echelon by battalion toward and within 400 yards of the river, where we halted until about 5. 30 p. m., when we crossed the river and halted 40 paces in rear of the line of skirmishers of the Third Brigade, Third Division, Second Corps, deploying the right company as skirmishers, connecting the left to the right of the Fourth Ohio Volunteers, Colonel Carroll's brigade, establishing the extreme right of the picket-line. At about 9 p. m. the remaining portion of my command was ordered to relieve the line of pickets in our front, which duty we performed, relieving the Fourth Ohio Volunteers, where we remained until about 12 p. m., when we withdrew the center of the line of pickets and recrossed the river, leaving Company H, Captain Thomas Cummings commanding, to hold the right until daybreak, arriving on the ground previously occupied by us about 1. 30 p. m., remaining there until 6 p. m. of the 7th, when we took up the line of march for camp, arriving at 9 p. m. No casualties.
Very respectfully,

H. W. HUDSON,

Colonel.
