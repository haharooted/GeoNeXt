HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,
May 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I am compelled to ask that Brigadier-General Hovey be relieved from command of his division, and that you send me a good division commander, or authorize me to assign one of the brigade commanders of another division to command General Hovey's division. I do not fell at liberty to make this change myself, because I understand General Hovey was assigned by the General-in-Chief. General Hovey is utterly inefficient and worthless as a division commander.

The difficulty seems to arise from some sort of mental disease. I do not dare to trust him in the handling of troops. He seems incapable of comprehending an order or of having any definite idea of what is transpiring around him. I regret this necessity very much, for I have a very high personal esteem for General Hovey, and believe he is unquestionably a most gallant soldier.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
