SANTA FE, N. MEX., October -, 1863.

Brigadier General W. A. HAMMOND,

Surgeon-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Agreeably to the wish conveyed in your letter of July 27, 1863, I send you the following history of that portion of the California Volunteers known as the Column from California. The march of this column from the Pacific Ocean to the Rio Grande is somewhat remarkable, from the fact that almost the entire distance is a desert waste, with great scarcity of water and that of the worst quality. Men marching day after day through the burning sands and nearly suffocated with alkali dust required to be made of stern stuff - of such were the men composing this column. Men inured to mountain life in California, pioneers and miners; men self-reliant and enduring; men equal to any emergency, if guided by a firm hand and clear head. That they were equal to a great emergency is evinced by the fact that they conquered vast deserts, and accomplished a march not equaled in modern times, traversing a distance of nearly a thousand miles and almost the entire route over a sterile waste.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES M. McNULTY,

Surgeon, U. S. Volunteers, Acting Medical Inspector.
