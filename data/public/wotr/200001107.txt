D. FERGUSSON,

Major, First Cavalry California Volunteers.

[Inclosure.]

DEAR THEODORE: I write this letter in hopes that it may reach you by some good luck. I am, as you may know, in command of this Territory as civil and military governor, having come up in July last with 375 men--thrashed and took prisoners all the troops at Fort Fillmore, 700 in number, and have held the country until the arrival of General Sibley with 4,000 Texans, who are now en route for Fort Craig, where Colonel Canby is, with 1,200 regulars and 2,800 greasers, all of whom will get used up in no time when the fight comes off. [I take] it for granted that you are with us. So far Mr. Lincoln is not making much headway in suppressing the rebellion. He has got himself thrashed in every fight from Manassas to Mesilla, and to-day we dare them to attack us at any point. I have only to say that I would be glad to see [you] with us, and the way is open. Sister is with me at Galveston [sic] who is Captain Wharton now and quartermaster. She wrote to you, but I have had no chance to send the letter. She was well by last better from San Antonio. Our family are all in the rebellion. I am [sic] and when the Union is restored by force of arms it will be when there is not a battalion of Southern men left to fight. I rely on your coming to me, for I can now aid you and give you a position; so come and bring with you in your own way all who want to fight for Dixie's Land.

Yours,

JNO R. BAYLOR.
