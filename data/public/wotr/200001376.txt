HDQRS. U. S. FORCES, LA FOURCHE DISTRICT,
Thibodeaux, La., January 21, 1864

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, New Orleans, La:

SIR: I have the honor to forward the following copy of a dispatch received from Major Grosvenor, commanding at Donaldsonville:

Colonel Sheldon sends me the following from Plaquemine last evening:

"A gentleman entitled to great confidence last night told me he was recently at Jackson, La., and saw there Wirt Adams with about 1,500 cavalry, and he says this is the force menacing Baton Rouge. He says on this side of the river, aside from pickets and couriers, there are a few hundred of the enemy near Morganza, about 4,000 at Alexandria, and quite a large army at Shreveport, waiting for the water to rise in the Red River to connect with their fleet at that point. Everything quiet about here. Nothing of importance occurred here."

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD L. MOLINEUX

Colonel, Commanding.
