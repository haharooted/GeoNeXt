No other troops in that vicinity. Twenty-two prisoners were made and 1 rebel killed in a skirmish with pickets. Sixteen horses and 1 mule and a sutler's wagon were taken. The parties sent out met with no loss. The family of Robinson, whom the general commanding sent to me for help some time since, was also brought away.
