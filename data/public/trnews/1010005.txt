A 23-year-old man is in a Winnipeg jail on human trafficking charges after police allege he held a woman
            against her will and forced her to work as an escort at various Winnipeg hotels.
            "She had been driven to Winnipeg from Montreal on Dec. 4 ... for this sole purpose," police wrote in a
            news release, adding she was threatened if she failed to comply.
            On Friday evening, city police were called to check on the well-being of a 23-year-old woman at a downtown
            hotel. She and the male suspect are both from Quebec.
            Winnipeg police Const. Jason Michalyshen said police made the arrest after hearing from the woman's family,
            who were concerned about her.
            He said the suspect allegedly assaulted the woman with a weapon while he was in control of her.
            "We were just thankful that we were able to respond quickly," Michalyshen said.
            A 19-year-old woman was also found with the 23-year-old woman and the man. She claimed to be his girlfriend.
            The man is charged with trafficking in persons, advertising sexual services and assault with a weapon.
            Alaya McIvor is a survivor of sex trafficking and now works with victims at Sage House, a street women's
            health and outreach centre.
            She was trafficked seven years ago across Canada and said the crime continues regularly in Winnipeg.
