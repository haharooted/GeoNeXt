"It is thus necessary, in the eyes of the government, to include the whole electoral period in the renewal time that we ask for," he added.
Last month, then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the provisions would likely be extended to give the extra powers delegated by emergency laws "to protect our democracy" during the April-May presidential vote.
Valls has said that authorities were monitoring around 15,000 people in France who they believe are in the process of radicalization and warned of hundreds of French jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria.
The provisions giving police additional powers in terror investigations were first implemented after a series of attacks left 130 people dead throughout Paris on November 13, 2015.
The terrorists struck in coordinated attacks at the Stade de France, outside the Petit Cambodge restaurant, in the Boulevard Voltaire, the Bonne Biere and the Belle Equipe cafes.
