GREEN fingered youngsters from an Edmonton school have been hard at work transforming a plot of drab open space into a flowery wonderland.
The pupils aged nine and ten from St Edmund’s Catholic Primary School in Hertford Road, Edmonton are members of the school’s gardening club.
The children dug flower beds, planted flowers, and landscaped the Crescent Conservation Area, in Hertford Road, close to their school, to make it a nice place for the wider community.
The final design was shaped by the people of Edmonton during a public consultation which took place in summer.
The project to improve the Crescent includes a new footpath, a central paved area, an arc of shaped trees and flowerbeds containing perennial flowers that provide a dash of colour all year round.
The project is designed to sustainably manage rainwater by allowing it to run off into the flowerbeds. The flowers have been specially chosen to encourage bees and butterflies to visit the area.
Head teacher, Margaret Hanley, said:
“Our pupils have enjoyed taking responsibility for planting an area they use on their way to  and from school. It has helped them to demonstrate good skills of citizenship, serving their community through their hard work.
“And it was great fun!”
Enfield Council’s cabinet member for education, children’s services and protection, Ayfer Orhan, said:
“This is a brilliant project, which has allowed the children to participate in a scheme that benefits the wider community.
"Every time they visit The Crescent they will be reminded how their efforts have made a genuine difference to the community and they should have an immense sense of pride and achievement in what they have done.
“They are a credit to the borough and we are very grateful for their hard work and endeavour.”
