A former presidential candidate looks likely to spur a last-minute recount of part of the result
            of the US election.
            Donald Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin, but two voting rights experts say the result needs
            to be more closely analysed.
            Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein says she has gathered enough money to fund a recount in
            Wisconsin.
            There is no indication Mr Trump's win was down to cyberhacking, one of the experts said on Wednesday.
            One election official in Wisconsin said they are preparing for a possible recount.
            What are the concerns?
            On Tuesday, New York magazine first reported that a group of experts, led by voting-rights lawyer John
            Bonifaz and J Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and
            Society, had contacted Mrs Clinton's campaign.
            The experts urged her campaign to request recounts in two states narrowly won by Mr Trump - Wisconsin and
            Pennsylvania - as well as Michigan, where he has a small lead.
            In a post on Medium on Wednesday, Mr Halderman repeated concerns he has voiced in the past over the
            vulnerabilities of paperless voting machines.
