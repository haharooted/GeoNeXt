HE SHOCKING OUTRAGE NEAR SHEFFIELD.  At the Sheffield Town-hall, yesterday, Thomas Davis, aged 37, engineer ; Richard Arlolaster, 35, collier; and Samuel jArlblaster, 30, collier, all residing near to the Manor Pit, belonging to Mr. B. Huntsman, were brought before the mayor (Mr. Alderman Moore) and the ex-mayor (Mr. Alderman Webster), charged with being concerned in the serious riot which teak place at the Manor, near Sheffield, on Saturday night Davis was specially charged with shooting at Mrs. Sykes, with intent to murder, and the other two prisoners were also charged with shooting as well as with taking part generally in the riot The prisorers were remanded. A warrant for the apprehension of Eiij »h Belton, against whom the charge of thooting at Wilfred Bowdeu would ba preferred, was applied for. Belton bad been apprehended at the time cf the riot, but subsequently released, because at the moment no evidence could be brought against him such as would justify his detention in custody. Since then, however, distinct evidence had been obtained that he waa there, and took part ia the riot, and that he shot a person of the name of Wilfred Bowden.—Mr. Binney Baid he must oppose the ap plication for a warrant, as Belton was a respec.able man—a bookkeeper in the service of Mr. Huntsman— and was perfectly ready to appear and answer to the charge when cal ed upon to do so.—Evidence havin: been given, the ex-Mayor said the tviJence already giv n was quite sufficient to justify the g anting of a warrant It was already proved that the man was out at midnight with fireaims in his hand, and along with the men who fired their pistols. One man was knocked down and shot at, and two or three i-e.ple were snot in the row. If the woman Sykes died there was no doubt, if the evidence alieaoy given was reliable, Belton would also be chargeable with having been accessory to her death, and he must of couise be locked up.—Warrant granted accordiagly.
