Friday’s and Saturday’s Posts.  LOXDOX, Aug. 9. HE Batavian Journals, received to the 3d inst. com* municate a statement generally accredited at Paris, that a Note, by way of ultimatum, has been delivered by the Russian Charge SAffaires, to the Minister for Foreign Adairs, demanding the evacuation of Hanover; and acquaining the French Government, that in case of a refusal, he had been directed by his Sovereign immediately to leave Paris. We are not much inclined to give credit to this statement, but it had the effect of depreciating the funds, which are said to have fallen one per cent, in consequence of it. On the SOlh ult. the French Minister at the Hague presented his new credentials, and a procession, suitable to the parade and ostentation of the Cars inns new title, took place on the occasion. Some Dutch papers inform us, that very gloomy rumours prevail at Paris with respect to the dispostions of Russia, and the other Northern Powers.—The French papers affect to treat these rumours with contempt, hut the French fund-i have fallen, and it is generally believed at Paris, that the Russian Charge dAffaires has delivered an ultimatum, in which the evacuation of Hanover is demanded; he accompanied that ultimatum with a declaration, stating, that he was directed to require a categorical answer within a few days, and to demand, Isis passports in the event of a refusal.
