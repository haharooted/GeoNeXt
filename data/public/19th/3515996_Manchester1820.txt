ROMAN CATHOLIC QUESTION.  In consequence of a requisition numerously and respectably signed, the high sheriff of the county of Surrey has appointed an anti-Catholic meeting to take place at Epsom, on Saturday the 21st inst. Leeds—A numerous and respectable meeting was held last week at Leeds, (the mayor in the chair) when it unanimously resolved to address his majesty and petition parliament against further concessions to the Catholics. Chester—Petitions to parliament and an address to the king against concessions to the Catholics are in course of signature at Chester. hey were placed for signature at two convenient places in the city at three oclock on \\\\ ednesday ; and by Thursday evening, at six oclock, they had received upwards of 2,000 names. OConkei.l—lt appears that OCcnnell (who has not yet attempted to take his seat) will be excluded from parliament by the new emancipation bill, which is only intended for the benefit of those Catholics who shall be elected after it has passed. he Clare election committee have reported to the house that OConnell had been duly elected, but this of course does not entitle htm to sit without previously taking the oaths. His name was not called over at the " call of the house" on the sth instant because his name does not appear on the house list or roll the names of new members not being inserted in that list until the new eturns are presented by those who have been elected.
