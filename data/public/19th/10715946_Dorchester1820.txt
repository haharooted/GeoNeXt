GLOUCESTERSHIRE.  Ploughing Match.—The annual Ploughing Match for the premiums offered by the Bath and West of England Society, took place on Friday, the 7th inst., in a piece of old ley, in the occupation of Mr. Hayward, half a mile from Cirencester. At half-post nine o’clock nineteen candidates were in the field, nine of whom had plough) drawn by two horses abreast without a driver, seven by three horses and a driver, and the other three by oxen. As soon as each man had marked out his half acre and set in again, the whole started together by signal, at a quarter before twelve o’cclock. he weather proved rather unfavourable, and there was not so large a concourse of persons attended as on a former occasion, in 1«26, when the last match took place in that neighbourhood. When the ploughmen had all finished their work, the committee and a large party of gentlemen repaired to the Fleece Inn, Cirencester, where an excellent dinner was provided by Mr. Brimble. Richard Spooner, Esq., took the chair, and was supported by Lord Sherborne, the Hon. Mr. Moreton, J. Cripps, Esq., M.P., and between seventy and eighty agriculturists,several of whom came out of Worcestershire in compliment to Mr. Spooner, knowing he was to lake the chair.
