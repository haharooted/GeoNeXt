SHEPTON MALLET.  Funeral of Lord Palmerston.—On Friday last the bells of our parish church rung out a muffled peal in memory to this great statesman. High Constable.—At a meeting of the Court Leet, at the George Hotel, Mr. Kelly, grocer, of this town, was appointed high constable for tho ensuing ye«r. 15th Somerset Rifle Corps. — The unonthly competition for the challenge cup and other prizes took place at the butts on Wednesday last. Private Goodman, who made the highest score, did not enter for the cup, and had in consequence to take a minor prize. he cup was therefore won by Sergt. Butler, .Private Goodman taking the salts and Sergt. Cook a gold pencilcase. Five Cottages Bubnt Down.—Early on Thursday morning the inhabitants of Shepton Mallet were aroused from their slumbers by the cries of fire in Cowlstreet. On proceeding to the spot four cottages were found in flames, and despite the heavy rain ths.t was falling at the time, tbey were burnt to the ground before daybreak. On Wednesday morning the chimney of one of the cottages caught fire, and it communicated to the roof; but it was put out, ns it was supposed, at the time. Early next morning the fire broke out afresh, and the three cottages adjoining, the roofs of which were of thatch, soon caught, and the whole was in a blazing mass. It was with great difficulty that tho furniture of the poor cottagers could be got away. Not a drop of water could be had, although Shepton Mallet is so abundantly supplied. he parish engines, too, are out of repair, and are carefully locked up. Another cottage was burnt to the ground on Thursday afternoon. It was adjoining those that were burnt on Thursday morning. One poor boy, by the name of Emery, nearly lost bis life in endeavouring to extinguish the flames. It appears he was on one of the side walls, when suddenly it gave way, and ho was precipitated into the burning mass below.
