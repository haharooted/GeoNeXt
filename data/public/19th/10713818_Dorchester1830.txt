FRANCE AND PORTUGAL.  Don Pedro has quitted England, and there is no doubt that he will solicit the” aid of France for the recovery of Portugal, and it is affirmed that there is as liule doubt but he will obtain it. It is reported that be did not leave England without repeatedly and urgently pressing the necessity of preventing his having recourse to any other power for aid ; and also that his anxious wishes were to obtain such aid or countenance from England as would prevent him from applying to France. It must therefore be clear, that if France should adopt his cause, and that cause prove successful, as it undoubtedly must under such circumstances, every advantage fiossessed by England, whether political or commercial, will be ost, and the honour and advantage of interference will be enjoyed exclusively by France. Every thing regarding the foreign policy of England appears under the present men to be in a gross state of mismanagement; and if we are to go on as we have lately done, it is evident that one or other of these things must occur; we must either submit to the loss of all political and commercial influence abroad—adopt a policy of interference in favour of freedom in other states—or in order to prevent the injury to our commerce and political character which would arise from the adoption of such a policy by France, go to v.vcjvMhJduilonea, ana fo effect this, it must fie evident toa cbmmon observer, that we must dissolve our present connection with that government, and enter into a closer intimacy with the conservative, though despotic governments of the north of Europe ; if we do not this, we must submit to an inglorious, and in the end. a ruinous system of inaction, and become a nation of lookers-on— whilst France, by a more active and vigorous policy, is quietly superseding our influence and power in every nation of Europe.
