HE HOLLANDS, OF DENTON.  In the great parish of Manchester were settled several Puritan families of considerable estates and influence, as the Hollands of Denton, the Hydes of Denton, the Birches of Birch, and the Worsleys of Platt. Around these old houses, and on lands purchased from them, other Puritans who had obtained their wealth from the prosperity of manufacturing industry, had in the seventeenth century established their families in good reputation, and brought considerable accession of strength and influence to the parliamentary CÂ£UIS6. he Hollands were known in Lancashire as early as the reign of John. Originally settled, as their name intimates, at Up-Holland, in the Hundred of West Derby, several of them were distinguished by their military renown, as especially Robert de Holland, who founded the priory of Black Monks in his native village. A younger son of the pious soldier (the Black Monks commemorated his great piety) married tbe heiress of Sir Alexander Denton, and established his family upon her lands. From the Reformation this family had been inclined to Puritanism, in the reign of Elizabeth, Prichard Holland, when high sheriff of the county, received the thanks of the Queen for his services in prosecuting Popish recusants and zealously promoting the Protestant religion. o persecuted Puritans under Tudor or Stuart, Denton House afforded a safe and hospitable asylum This fami y was among the earliest to avow itself on the side of the parliament. A great-nephew of the persecutor of the 1 apists took the command of Manchester when it was besieged by the Royalists. Of this ancient and honourable faiW. long distinguished in the annals of the county, the name has passed away, and the estate has descended through an heiress to the Earl of Wilton, the present representative of two great Puritan families of Lancashire^
