NETHERLANDS.  he King of the Netherlands has recently issued a decree, in which it is ordained that all wine, beer, vinegar, spirits salt, sugar, beef, and pork, brought from the rebellious provinces into Holland, shall be considered as coming from a foreign country, and shall be charged with Excise duties accordingly; and that the exportation from Holland to the said rebellious provinces. of grain, salt, gunpowder, and all descriptions of military stores, shall be strictly prohibited.  It is difficult to ascertain the motives which guide the actions of the Prince of Orange in Belgium. He has issued a Proclamation full of double meanings, so as to excite the surprise even of his royal father. his is a sort of temporizing policy which is unworthy of a great statesman, and betrays the little, narrow, cunning of a weak man. it will serve to render him coi.temptible in the eyes of the revolutionary Belgians, who already laugh at his want of vigourous measures. here must be no law of expediency in the Councils of the King of the Netherlands respecting Belgiumâ€”either he must subdue his rebellious subjects by the sword, or he must acknowledge them to form an independent state; his government must not be carried forward in this truckling manner. he King seems to rely upon hi# own good intentions, and to suppose that his worthy allies who guaranteed the kingdom to his family, will come and assist him in action with their troops. Belgium ever was and seem# destined to be the firebrand of Europe. he barrier towns appear yet likely to be the foundation of a new European war, and the fields of Flanders to be the localities of many hard-fought battles, as in the olden time.
