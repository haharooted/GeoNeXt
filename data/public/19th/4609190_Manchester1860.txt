ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.  Dublin University.—We have authority for stating that Mr. H. E. Chatterton, will present himself to the electors of the University of Dublin, in tbe event of a vacancy occurring. here are now four candidates in the field—Mr. J. E. Walsh, Q.C.; Sir Elward Grogan, Mr. Chatterton, and Mr. R. Longtield.— Lublin Evening MaiU Corrupt Practices at Elections.—A return has been issued from which it appears that ten royal commissioners have been appointed to investigate the conupt practices at elections since 1852. Six of these were appointed in 1853, one in 1857, and three in 1859. he total expenses have amounted to £21,466 6s. 5d., of which £12,111 19s. 7d. are appropriated to general expenses, £3,463 6s. 3d. to shorthand-writing, and £5,891 os. 7d. to printing and stationery. Eight prosecutions were ordered at an expense of £4,952 3s. 4d., but as in each a case a nolle prosequi was entered, the prosecutions have, of course, meant nothing. he Helston Election Committee.—The Helston election committee, which meets to-day, must of necessity last a considerable time. After disposing of the first question, namely, whether the mayors casting vote, which decided ihe election, was properly received or no, the scrutiny v ill be proceeded with. wenty of the votes recorded for the fitting member (Mr. Campbell) are disputed by the petitioners, whilst eighty of the votes recorded for Mr. Baliol Brett, the unsuccessful candidate at the last election and one of the petitioners against the return of Mr. Campbell, are disputed by the agents for that gentleman. __
