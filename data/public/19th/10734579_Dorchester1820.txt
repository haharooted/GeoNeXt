A CH A t.I.r.NG R. 1 challenge the world to produce, if it can, A Blacking that’s equal to Turner’s Japan : For like crystal it shines, while it softens the leather. And makes your boots proof gainst the wind and.the weather. Why the praises of Turners Japan should I tell. When those who have used it must know it so well ? Why should coachmen still brush at old harness in vain, When this blacking can give it fresh lustre again! For, without second sight, I can prophecy soon, That you will see it adopted by Foot and Dragoon ; For you scarcely can tell, when drawn up on parade, Which glitters the brightest, the boot or the blade. he Gentlemen too, who would boast their attire. And feel for respect so profound a desire. May hear the fair Ladies, if Turners they uae, Cry, How charmingly polished his manners and shoes* Vc Authors and Poets who gladly engage To reform and instruct this degenerate age. Use Turners Japan and your fame will take root. hen your genius will shine as well as your boot. 1 hough Davy and Home have astonished the world. And the chemical volume of nature unfurl’d, Yet in chemistry surely there something was lacking, TUI Turner discover’d his wonderful Blacking. Who do not feel pride in a Wellingtons name. When the whole of the universe rings with his fame 1 So arc Turner and Wellinoion famous afar,  One the hero of Blacking, the other of War!! Gentlemen may observe that this Composition, when wed for their Gig and Carriage Harness, after one or two application* will produce a brilliant, rich, glossy black lustre, and it the same time act as a preserver of the leather, RICHARD IX RNER.
