WEST COAST OF AFRICA.  he royal mail steamship Athenian arrived at Liverpool on Saturday from the West Coast of Africa.

Fortunately a plucky Krooman stood at the door of her room with a loaded pistol in his hand, and swore he would shoot the first man who attempted to cross the threshold. By this means the Krooman covered Mrs. Henrys retreat, who, by this time, had made her escape out of the back entrance of the house, and ran torn miles into the bush, wading up to her waist in mud and water. At night she journeyed down to Messrs. Horsfalls factory. he extreme fright caused such a shock to her nervous system that she took fever, accompanied with congestion of the brain, and died four days after the occurrence. he natives would not allow Dr. Henry to bury her in the ground appropriated for the graves of white men. A British gunboat was to be sent down to teacfc these cowardly rascals a salutary lesson.
