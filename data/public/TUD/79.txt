The Moroccan agricultural communities expect a good agricultural season after bountiful rainfall recorded recently in the Kingdom, while some experts say that nothing is guaranteed yet, and April forecast will be decisive on the size of the year’s harvest.

Sources from the Ministry of Agriculture attributed the prevailing optimism within the ministry to the last term significant rainfall rate, which led to filling dams by “more than 80% on the whole compared to 69% in the same period last year”, reported Medi1TV on its Monday news bulletin.

According to medi1TV, the volume of main dams of the kingdom reaches 13.76 billion cubic meter.

The Channel added that experts expect Morocco’s production of cereals, which constitute 80 per cent of Moroccan crops, to reach 50 million quintals, and may reach 100 million quintals if the rain falls generously on April.

Studies show that the annual consumption of bread, which is the most reliable staple food in Morocco, is 1150 (raghif) loaves per person, 790 loaves per person in Tunisia and 500 loaves in Egypt.

Ahmed Ouayach, President of the Moroccan Confederation of Agriculture and Rural Development, (COMADER) pointed out that “all expectations remain subject to April rainfalls, which are critical, to a large extent, to the success of any agricultural season in Morocco.”

It is noteworthy that this season began under a lot of positive variables, given that the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries works together with the rest of the actors in the field, to monitor potential necessary preparations for the success of the season, including the provision of seeds, estimated at 1.5 million quintals, and 1 million quintal of fertilizers.
