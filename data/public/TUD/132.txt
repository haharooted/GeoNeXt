Undeterred by high inflationary pressure, Indians are likely to spend more on vacation this year with most of them preferring either a holiday with family or adventure travel, a study has claimed.

Despite high inflationary pressure and an overall economic outlook, which doesn't predict much increase in salaries, about 77 per cent Indians said they were planning to increase their travel spend this year, a biannual study conducted by independent research firm Strategy One, done on behalf of Trip Advisor, has found.

"Indians favoured was a holiday with family or kids the most, with 22 per cent respondents choosing it as their preferred type of trip. An adventure trip was the second most preferred type of trip chosen by 16 per cent of the Indians, much higher than the world average of 11 per cent. India was placed with Germany, France and Egypt as countries that ranked highest for 'Adventure' trip," it said.

Although beach holidays were preferred by majority across various countries, it was the third choice for Indians followed by cultural trips. Winter sports holidays were the least preferred holidays across the globe, including India," the Trip Barometer study, which was conducted world wide, said.

Majority of Indians, about 61 per cent, travelled on leisure for their last trip followed next by 'Visiting Family and Friends' at 21 per cent, much higher than the global or Asia average of 18 per cent. Also, India ranked highest at 16 per cent among all countries (along with Egypt and South Africa) for those who last travelled for business.
