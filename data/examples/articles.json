    "case": "Marc Emery, known as Canada's 'Prince of Pot', was arrested in Montreal along with nine others during police raids on six newly opened Cannabis Culture stores. He faces charges of drug trafficking, possession for the purpose of trafficking, and conspiracy. Emery was released on a $5,000 bond with conditions: he must not consume cannabis, enter cannabis-related establishments, or contact anyone tied to Cannabis Culture in Montreal. He is barred from staying in Quebec except for court dates. Police are pressuring landlords to keep the stores closed, and officers were seen verifying that they remained shut."
