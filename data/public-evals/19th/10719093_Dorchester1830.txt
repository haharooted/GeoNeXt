Gentlemen, BEFORE I leave the County, whence I am called by the serious Illness of an early Friend and Relative, 1 am anxious to thank the Electors whom I have visited for the kindness and courtesy with which they have received me. o all whom 1 have not been hitherto able to visit I would state that of the twenty-four days (Sundays excepted) which have elapsed since the Election, eighteen have been spent in redeeming my engagement to pay my personal respects to every individual Constituent, whilst of the remaining time three days have been given to public business. 1 trust that any Electors whom 1 may have omitted to call on within the districts I have already visited, will attribute the omission to its real cause, my ignorance of their respective abodes, and not to any intentional disrespect towards themselves.
