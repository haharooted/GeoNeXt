PORTUGAL.  he political misfortunes of to speak in the mildest terms, have either banished or immured in prison, every man who hud the aplrit to complain of the tyranny, cruelty, and oppression of Don Miguel and his ministers. Poverty, distrust, and misery, are now the only things known in Lisbon. he Hritish government, it appears, are about to renew the relations of .intercourse and amity with the Portuguese nation, an intercourse which has now been long interrupted. Don Miguel having determined to perform a great act of justice and humanity (we speak in the advised language of William the Fourth), by the grant of a general amnesty, the time has arrived, or may shortly arrive, when this intercourse may be effected with that security which his most Faithful Majesty. Don Miguel, seems disposed to grant. We trust that these things may prove true, and he attended with all t!>e good that this nation has a tight to expect.
