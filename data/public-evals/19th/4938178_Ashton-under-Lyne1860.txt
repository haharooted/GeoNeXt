HE IRISH CHURCH DEBATE.  he Daily News remarks that Mr, Disraeli creditably abstained from those coarse iacentivts to sectarian fanaticism to which twelve months ago he made happily a vain appeal. he Times says that Himsiness relieved with spangles is too apt a description of the speech. English Tory members, and still more the excellent Protestants of Ireland, wanted good rousing denunciations of Papists and the ministry—opportunities for outbursts of Kentish fire—and what did they get ? Mr. Disraeli was laboriously civil to the Roman Catholics. He absolutely seconded Bishop Moriarty’s suggestion that the compensation for the withdrawal of the M.iynooth grant should be paid out of the imperial exchequer, instead of out of the funds of the Irish Establishment. o the men at his back, whose life and soul were in the matter in hand, his speech was wholly incomprehensible and disappointing. he Daily Telegraph says it is understood that no more cabinet ministers than is absolutely necessary shall speak in the debate on the Irish Church as at present arranged. Mr. Bright addressed the House last night (Friday), and Mr. Lowe on Monday next. here is little chance of the debate closing before a late hour on Wednesday morning. he lowest majority for the second reading is reckoned at 110, but even a larger majority is expected. he same paper says that Mr. Disraeli’s peroration was well pronounced,fcand Stly concluded a speech which in its delivery was fully sustained in all its rhetorical phases, and as a parlirmentary exercitation amply deserved the applause which followed its conclusion.  he Standard praises its studied moderation. he Heraldry* it was one of the finest speeches ever delivered in parliament, and sustained a great argument for English liberties.
