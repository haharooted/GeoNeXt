AGRICULTURE.  MONTHLY REPORT FOR JULY. he harvest is commenced in many parts of the Eastern district, where all the Rye, and many pieces of Oats are a lready cut, and some wheat has been reaped on warm soils. In Cambridge and Huntingdonshire their crop of bread corn was never more promising. he corn in the Western counties, and most part of North Wales, is more free from infection than those of any other district that we have seen. Oats and barley are likely to rise to a full average crop; and both beans and peas are well podded for abundant produce. Potatoes are likely to prove a large crop, and good in quality. urnips have planted favourably every where. Hops are now securely set for a large and unusual crop ; the duty is laid at t!(V),tXK)I. he cyder counties of Devon and Herefordshire have lately lost their apples; in Worcestershire they reckon on a third of a crop. he hay harvest in the North has sulfered considerably from the heavy rains, and is not yet closed. Smithfield has been rather thinly supplied through the month with good beef, mutton, and iamb, and high prices are still sustained in consequence. he Eastern and Northern fairs have had large shews of lean cattle, and a reduction of price has taken place, particularly in Scotch runts, and Irish steers. Store sheep and lambs are in demand, and fetch more money. he wool markets are very brisk. he Down wool has reached 22d. per 11). and the prime long fleece 18d. he rye crops in the county of Cambridge are uncommonly fine ; several farmers have begun to carry them. In all parts of Norfolk the turnip crop is uncommonly good, and the hoeing lias already commenced.â€”New hay from the meadow sells at from 70 to 755. jier Waggon load, of about two tons.
