NEUTRAL TRADE WITH TEXAS.  ho Times refers to President Johnsons proclamation of May 22 for opening trade to all ports except those of Texas, and remarks :â€” It does not go so far as the action of the British Government would seem to warrant. he President allows to neutrals the same rights, and subjects them to the same liabilities as if the belligerent status of the Texans were undoubted ; that President Johnson does this at a time when we have arrived at the conclusion that the secessionist forces in Texas are too irregular to allow us any longer to regard the Confederate ships of war as commissioned by a regular government is creditable to his moderation, and is another instance of the respect for law which has guided the United States government in its dealings with foreign nations, and we may hope will guide it in the future. he Times expresses a hope that the moderation of the sident will not be unrewarded, and that English vessels will not be found attempting to enter Galvestm and Brownsville.
