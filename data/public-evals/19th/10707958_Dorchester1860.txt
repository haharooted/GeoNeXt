Funeral of Me. John Leech.  On Friday afternoon, at 2 oclock, the mortal remains of Mr. Johu Leech were deposited in Kensal-green Cemetery. he Harrow-road was dotted with pedestrians, now single figures, now in groups of two or three, men who by their beards, their bearing, that special something which is at once recognisable to the initiated but which defies description, proclaimed themselves artists. hen cabs and carriages came rolling up the road, containing some of those faces the world is familiar with through the medium of the camera and the carte de visile shops-—literary men, artists, sculptors, actors, journalists. hese were all dressed in black, and were all bound for the same destination—the great necropolis where repose the remains of many London celebrities, whither not a year ago nearly the same crowd was hastening to witness the sepulture of Thackeray. o this last event a reference was naturally enough in every mouth, for the dead had not only been Thackerays eaily schoolfellow, but his intimate and familiar friend ; men whispered to each other that one great reason of Leechs moving to Kensington was to be near Thackeray, and loving each other in their lives, it might almost be said that in their death they were not divided, as but one intervening grave prevents their dust from commingling.
