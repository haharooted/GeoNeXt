MURPHY STABBED IN THE HAND AT OLDHAM  . On Wednesday night, just as the place where he had been lecturing was nearly vacated, some noise being heard outside, Mr. Murphy came hurriedly out of his tent with his revolver in his hand hanging down behind him, and, making his way among the crowd, seemed to be looking for some particular person, whom he had remarked as being concerned in a disturbance during the lecture. He was n*t above a couple of yiirds from the tent door when he recognised the individual, and repeating the words, “You be off with you ! What are you doing here ?” was pushing him through the crowd when the man drew a weapon and struck at Mr. Murphy’s extended hand, inflicting a wound along the palm about an inch in length. After this the party bolted, Murphy, following out his frequently-expressed determination to be his own constable, immediately, amidst the cries of “ Shoot him?” “ Shoot the b I” ran off in hot pursuit Murphy overtook him, and he and his followers seized him, the latter “puncing” and striking him most mercilessly. Murphy took no part in the latter proceeding; but apparently satisfied that the man was caught returned to the tent. By some means or other, however, he escaped. When Murphy arrived at the tent he vehemently appealed to the police officers to go and take the man in charge, exhibiting the bleeding hand to them ; but they told Murphy he could expect nothing else if he ran awny frem his tent as he had done, and told him to keep inside. he Chief-constable coming up, Murphy said to him, “I was Just coining out of the door of the tent to my cab when a man stabbed me in the hand, and I teld the officers to take him and they would not.” his of course was u»tme, but the cab soon after arrived and Murphy drove off.—He is still lecturing at Oldham.
