UP, RADS, TO THE RESCUE ! BY ROBERT STORY. Up, rads, to the rescue! beU blade, and away! For great is the danger, and deep the dismay. By insult unmoved, and by menace unscared, The peers of Great Britain have done at they dared; And the pet bill of Melbourne is gasping for breath— O fly to the rescue, and snatch it from death ! Away !—in the Commons despondency fflooms; Chagrined are the Harveys, indignant the Humes; The tears of Lord Johnny are streaming like rain, And Morpeth his handkerchief gropes for in vain; For OConnell, (whose rent is secure,) at his side. Hath seized it, his laughter to stifle and hide! Away!—ere Sir Robert, the good and the great, Assumes his old post at the rudder of state; Ere Lyndhurst, unmatched and unmarked by a flaw, Dispenses, as chancellor, justice and law; Ere Arthur, the victor supreme and alone, Has marshalled his bands in defence of the throne! Away ! ye are thousands—what! blanch ye to miss The leaders ye hoped at a crisis like this ? Why all whom the love of confusion allures, The Papist—the reasonless Papist—is yours; Nor breathes there an infidel wretch in the land But will borrow a weapon, and march in your band! Yet pause. here are thousands atraintt you who neer Bowed down to your idol in faith or in fear; And, though Erin he hostile, and Scotland be slack, The peers of old England have her at their back, And sooner shell die than her nobles shall quail To the might of the rump, or the lash of the tail!
