NEW BAILEY.-Thursday, September 27.  "".it, . ..i i I..,.ill... LIST OF JURORS. Pursuant to a precept from the high constable, the constables of the different townships in the Hundred of Sal ford, presented lists of persons qualified to serve as jurors, and made oath as to their correctness. A complaint under the Hulme police act was preferred, by order of the commissioners, against a gentleman of the name of Nuttall, residing in Jackson s-lane, for having made a-communication by means of a sough with the main sewer, which crosses the turnpike road and empties itself into the late Duke of Bridgwaters slate yard. It appears, by a clause in the police act, that any person making a communication with the main sewer, without the consent of the commissioners of police, are liable to a fine of Â£5. Mr. Bags haw, who appeared on the part of Mr. Nuttall, contended that the sewer in question was not a common sewer, but private property. It had been made many years ago, by Mr. Lloyd, for the purpose of draining his land, which lay in the neighbourhood of Jackson s-lane. Mr. Johnson, the deputy constable of Hulme, who preferred the complaint, not being in a condition to prove that it was the common sewer, the case was postponed until next Thursday.
