HE MANCHESTER COURIER.  SaTurtjat), 3anÂ«arn, 1, 1825. ~Thb Courier of Thursday evening contains the official Returns of the last Quarters Revenue; from which it would appear, that although one million one hundred and fifty thousand pounds have been given up in remitted duties, the produce of the Customs of the present year is only 108,0001. less than that of the year preceding. In the Ex. cise there is a decided increase of 1,150,8161. he Excise, the Stamps, the Post-office, the Taxes, and the miscellaneous sources of income, are all more or less improving. he  increase on the first of these items, is no les3 than 703,4311 above that of the corresponding quarter of lb23. Allowing for the deficiency in the Customs, which must necessarily arise from the immense remission of duties, the total increase on the last Quarter is 140,0001. o this increase must be added the amount of the Austrian repayment. Setting that item aside, and the amount, 700,0071. being added, as it ought to be, the increase specified will present a total improvement of 912,0071. If the various duties remitted, and the disbursements made during the last year, be taken into consideration, the amount of the Revenue will be found to have increased in a manner as gratifying as it is extraordinary; and in addition to the prosperous state of our finances, the commercial interests of the country appear to be in an equally improving and flourishing condition.
