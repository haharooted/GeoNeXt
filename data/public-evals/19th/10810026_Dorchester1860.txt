DEVONSHIRE.  EXETER. Diocesan Boabd of Education.â€”The annual meeting of the Exeter Diocesan Board of Education took place on Tuesday, the 7th, at the Training College, Exeter. From the reports which were read by Canon YVoollcombe, it appeared that the working of the Training College during the past year bad been most successful, the attainments of the students bad beeu high, aud those who had finished tht ir training had been able to secure situations without any difficulty. he diocesan inspectors report referred to tho Prayer Book prize scheme of the Lord Bishop of the diocese. he result of the first examination was satisfactory, although the mode of examination and tho distribution of the prizes had not met with universal favour. he Board would give attentive consideration to any suggestion tbat could be made to enable the scheme to be more beneficial in its working. he rules of the first year would not be enforced in future years if experience should teach that they could be rendered more efficient. Amongst the speakers was the Rev. Prebendary Barnes, who alluded to the system pursued by Miss Burdett Coutts amongst tbe small rural schools. he plan propounded by that lady had rapidly developed itself. he scheme was not proposed merely for the Church of England schools, but ior all schools throughout the country, and was intended us part of a national movement for education. By its adoption it was sought to free the management of the smaller schools from very many of tbe regulations of the present Code of Education, so as to allow them to share in tbe benefits of Government grants, on showing results equal to those obtained by schools more exactly in accordance with Government regulations. Payment by results was the principle of the Revised Code, and taking that principle, he was asked whether he could not obtain in the country districts of Mary Church results nearly equal to those schools under Government.
