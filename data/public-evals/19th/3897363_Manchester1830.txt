DECLINING POPULARITY OF THE GOVERNMENT.  (From the Oxford Herald.) " If my gossip report be an honest woman of her I word," there seem grounds for believing the ministry j have had some rather disagreeable intimations that they cannot much longer look for staunch support among the highest order of the aristocracy. It would certainly be nothing very marvellous, if the Howards and Fitzgeralds, the Cavendishes and Fitzroys, evinced a repugnance at stooping so low as to degrade their ducal necks into a mere stepping-stone for the purpose of raising into his saddle the white-feathered champion of repeal, whose career is bound for the same bourn as that of other beggars when set on horsback. If such supporters become scarce, it will proportionally enhance the value of those who still remain. he Duke of Roxburghe has just succeeded in foisting on the register in Scotland twenty-six fictitious votes by granting life-rent qualifications on the lands of Crooked-Shaws, to individuals who are for the most part cottagers dependent on the duke. We learn, in the same paper that gives us this information, that his grace is to be rewarded for this crooked manoeuvre with the vacant green ribbon.â€” How appropriate the remark ! his reminds us of the two bold aeronauts who rejoiced in the name of Green ; the one contented himself with mounting in a car; i nothing would satisfy his more venturesome relative but soaring into the clouds on the back of a Highland pony, even at the risk of a Highland fling: the former was called simple Green, the latter very Green. In wishing his grace joy of his simple green ribbon, we wish he may live to enjoy it to a very green old age. In spite, however, of fifty votes to be created by Lord Palmerston on his estates in Ireland, and some dozens more by A. B. and C. D., the registrations are every where progressing most favourably to the Conservative cause.
