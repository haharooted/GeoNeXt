HE MERCURY.  MANCHESTER, OCTOBER 13, 18-23. It will be teen from our foreign intelligence, that a preliminary treaty of peace has been concluded between the Russians and the Tarks; but at present the terms of that treaty are not accurately known. From the accounts given of them in the French and German papers, they appear to be sufficiently hard upon the Turks; but, nobody would suppose, notwithstanding the moderation which the Emperor of Hi sst* has professed through, otrt the contest, that he would be satisfied without effecVitally humbling his opponents. With the concessions which he is now stated to have attained, and with the experience of the war just concluded, it may be safely said that the Turkish empire lies at his mercy, and must fall whenever he chooses to shake it down. It is, indeed,, rumoured that the French and English ambassadors have protested against the conditions of the treaty which has been imposed upon the Turks; but we do not believe the | report. he conditions (if truly slated in the accounts we have of them), are such as might naturally be expected ; and it would be very foolish for either the French or the English government to quarrel with Russia respecting them. {
