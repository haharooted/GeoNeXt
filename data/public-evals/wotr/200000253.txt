HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF ARKANSAS,

Little Rock, January 18, 1864

Honorable S. H. BOYD, Member of Congress:

DEAR SIR: The Missouri Democrat of the 5th instant contains what purports to be a letter, or an extract from a letter, addressed to you by Brigadier General J. W. Davidson. I write to inform you that certain statements therein contained relating to the so-called "conciliatory policy" are false. If General Davidson is the author of that letter he has proved himself an ungrateful scoundrel. You can use my name for these facts whenever you please.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED'K STEELE,

Major-General, Commanding.
