FORT MONROE, VA., April 21, 1864. (Received 1. 45 p. m.)

Rear-Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN,

Washington, D. C.:

The remains are not so far within my control as to be able to remove them from Richmond, where every effort is being made by the detectives to find them; but they are, I am informed and believe, in the hands of devoted friends of the Union, who have taken possession of them in order that proper respect may be shown to them at a time which I trust is not far distant. I hardly dare suggest to Ould, when he reports to me, as he will, that he cannot find them, that I can put them into his possession, because that will show such a correspondence with Richmond as will alarm them, and will redouble their vigilance to detect my of information. I am, however, under the direction of the President.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
