CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., May 29, 1864

General EWING,

Commanding:

A squad of our men killed the notorious guerrilla, Captain Watson, of the swamp thieves, at Gum Slough yesterday. They were sent out from Bloomfield. He was one of the worst of outlaws-as bad as Bolin. Nat. Bolin, with 20 guerrillas, was heard from yesterday on Horse Island. Forty men have been sent out to kill them.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
