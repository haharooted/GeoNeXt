HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
New Orleans, January 21, 1864

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Thirteenth Army Corps, New Orleans:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding the department desires you to instruct Major-General Dana to make arrangements at Decrow's Point, Indianola, or such other point or points as he (General Dana) may select for the defense of his command in case the enemy should attack in force. He must be prepared for this. Should there be reason to apprehend attack from the enemy's gun-boats, the approaches, by water should be swept by artillery, and submarine obstructions and destructive arranged.

The commanding general wishes Major-General Dana to understand that he does not for the present contemplate assuming the offensive from the positions now occupied by General Dana, and that it may be necessary to withdraw a portion of the forces now there for operations elsewhere. For this reason the means of transportation called for are not now forwarded. The men now here belonging to regiments there may remain here until it shall be decided which regiments will remain with General Dana. A pile-driver and piles, small-boats, seines, and supplies of forage and lumber clothing, camp and garrison equipage, and other necessaries will be sent to General Dana; also artisans and materials for the repair of the steamer Warrior. Cavalry will be sent as soon as the means of transportation admit.

Very respectfully, I am, general your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
