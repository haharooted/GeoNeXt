HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE NORTHWEST, Milwaukee, Wis., April 15, 1864.

Captain JOHN FEILNER,

First U. S. Cavalry, Engineer:

CAPTAIN: In addition to your duties as topographical engineer of the expedition of General Sully into the Indian country, you will please make to these headquarters upon your return as full a report as possible upon the geology, botany, natural history, and physical character generally of the region over which the operations of the expedition will extend. As full meteorological observations should be made as opportunity and the means at your disposal render practicable. I need not remind you of the important results to science which will ensue from ever a partial success in these observations.

General Sully has been furnished with a copy of this letter, and will give you all the assistance at his command in carrying out these instructions as far as circumstances will permit. I have myself made very complete collections, both of natural history and botanical and mineralogical specimens, by instructing 2 or 3 enlisted men how to make them, and keeping them constantly employed. I need not suggest to you that it is best to bring in specimens of everything, however common, as it is of as much, if indeed not of more interest to science to determine the geographical distributions of known species than to discover what is new.

The ordinary extra pay will be given to enlisted men employed by you in this service.

I am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
