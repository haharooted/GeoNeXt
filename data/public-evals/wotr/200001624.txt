HYDESVILLE, October 21, 1862

SIR: I started from this place this morning, 7. 30 o'clock, en route for Fort Baker. The express having started an hour before, I had no escort. About two miles from Simmons' ranch I was attacked by a party of Indians. As soon as they fired they tried to surround me. I returned their fire and retreated down the hill. A portion of them cut me off and fired again. I returned their fire and killed one of them. They did not follow any farther. I will start this evening for my post as I think it will be safer to pass this portin of the country in the night. Those Indians were lurking about of rthe purpose of robbing Cooper's Mills. They could have no othe robject, and I think it would be well to have eight or ten men stationed at that place, as it will serve as an outpost for the settlement, as well as a guard for the mills. The expressmen disobeyed my orders by starting without me this morning.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. FLYNN,

Captain, Second Infantry California Volunteers.

First Lieutenant JOHN HANNA, Jr.,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Humboldt Military District.
