FOOT OF POTATO HILL, May 10, 1864.

Captain LE ROY:

My column is nearly at foot of Potato Hill, my skirmishers to its base. There are strong indications of its being evacuated. Since 12 m. they have been moving trains of wagons to the rear. My men occupy the ridge west of the railroad, way to the point, and will soon be over to the railroad. I am past the left of the infantry, and up with skirmishers.

J. B. DORR,

Colonel, Commanding.
