HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,
Little Rock, Ark., June 3, 1864.

Colonel GEIGER,

Commanding Eighth Missouri Cavalry, Devall's Bluff:

As soon as your regiment returns encamp it on Bayou Two Prairies, south of the railroad, near Ashley's Station. All the cavalry encamped there will be under your command for the present. When the battalion of the Ninth Iowa relieves your command along Little Red, the detachment of the Tenth Illinois will move direct to its regiment at Little Rock, and your regiment will go direct to camp near Ashley's Station, or by way of Devall's Bluff, as you may prefer.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
