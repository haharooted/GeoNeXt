FEBRUARY 22, 1864.-Affair near Indianola, Tex.

Report of Major General Napoleon J. T. Dana, U. S. Army.

HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES IN TEXAS,
Matagorda Bay, February 23, 1864.

SIR: Brigadier-General Warren, commanding at Indianola, reports that 25 mounted infantrymen, who were scouting and driving cattle 8 miles from his post yesterday, were surrounded and charged upon by well-armed and well-mounted cavalry of the enemy, 55 strong. The horses of our men were poor scrubs and not trained to fire, and when the men fired a volley at the distance of 50 yards, 14 of them were unhorsed. The enemy immediately closed on them with revolvers, and the 14 were captured, the other 11 escaping. General Warren reports that the affair reflects no credit on the officer in command, and I have notified him that I expect an investigation.

Very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.

Captain A. B. SHARPE,

Act. Asst. Adjt. General, 13th Corps, New Orleans.
