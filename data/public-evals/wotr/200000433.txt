COLONEL: You will direct Colonel Fuller, at Dardanelle, to send a good officer and 50 men to Clarksville to see why the telegraph line above that point cannot be kept in repair. You will instruct him to see to it that it is placed in good condition, and then the detail will return to Dardanelle. They will shoot or hang every guerrilla who has or may interfere with the line.
