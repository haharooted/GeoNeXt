General WEST,

Commanding Forces at Springfield, Ark.;

SIR: I have the honor to report that I met a detachment of your command last evening at Norristown. All was well at Fort Smith when we left that point on the 25th. Clarksville is occupied by Colonel Cloud, Second Kansas Volunteer Cavalry. I routed Jackman on Piney, 7 miles northwest of Dover; captured 15 of his men. Went to Dover but found no enemy. Coffee gone after Shelby. General Thayer wishes you to communicate with [him]. You can meet our scouts east of Clarksville. You have all the news that we have about Shelby. I can hear nothing of Cabell. I cannot hear of his whereabouts.

I am, general your obedient servant,

W. DOUDNA,

Major Ninth Kansas Volunteer Cav., Commanding Battalion.
