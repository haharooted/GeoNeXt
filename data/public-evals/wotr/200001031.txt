Major C. T. CHRISTENSEN,
Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Div. of the Mississippi:

MAJOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt by steamer Clyde of your communication of 17th instant, with the extract of General Sherman's dispatch requiring me to look out for his force before the 20th or 25th of July. I will start accordingly to-morrow, with 1,000 infantry, 2 pieces of artillery, and 50 mounted men, toward Pollard, and should I not find the announced force I will strike the railroad myself. The steamer Hudson will anchor day after to-morrow, the 22nd instant, off Pensacola City, loaded with commissary stores and forage for Sherman's force.

I beg to thank the commanding general for the promised cavalry horses, and the additional regiment of cavalry. They will not lie idle, the commanding general may rely upon that.

I am, very respectfully, major, your obedient servant,

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
