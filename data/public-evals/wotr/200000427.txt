HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF, Grand Ecore, La., April 16, 1864.

Brigadier General A. J. SMITH,
Commanding, &c., Grand Ecore:

GENERAL: L Your dispatch of this date informing me of the return of the last of your transports from the upper river, and of your orders from Major General W. T. Sherman to return immediately with your command to Vicksburg, is received. The low stage of the water in Red River, and the difficulties encountered in our campaign consequent thereon makes it impossible for me to dispense with your services as soon as I anticipated. Did it not involve more than the abandonment of the expedition I might consider

General Sherman's orders as imperative, but it is impassible for the navy to remove below at this time, and the withdrawal of your command at this movement will place my forces at the mercy of the enemy, who is in larger force than General Sherman could have anticipated. The safety, therefore, of the navy and the army camped me reluctantly to withhold my consent to your departure, and for this reason I must request you to remain, notwithstanding your orders, and will assume myself the responsibility for this course. I have written to General Sharman a full statement of the situation, and cannot but believe he will concur with Admiral Porter and myself, as well as the other officers of my command, in this decision.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
