SPRINGFIELD, MO., January 29, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The squadrons of the Eleventh Missouri Cavalry may not be back for ten or twelve days. They will be ordered back as soon as we compel the enemy to retire from Northern Arkansas, which I think cannot required more than two weeks more.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
