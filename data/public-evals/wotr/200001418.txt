LACLEDE, MO., April 14, 1864.

Brigadier General C. B. FISK:

SIR: I send you a statement of William D. Vice, a good, reliable Union man, who, I think, knows whereof he affirms. We have within the last week captured 4 men and sent them to Macon. Supposed to be concerned with the gang that Vice speak of. We found stolen horses and other property with them. The citizens of this county and Chariton ask that something be done to relieve them from such characters. I sent to Macon on yesterday for 25 men and have not received an answer yet. From the best evidence I can obtain the rebels are organizing through this county to prevent the draft.

Your most obedient servant,

W. J. PORTER,

Assistant Provost-Marshal.
