FORT SUMTER, February 13, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that two self-anchoring torpedoes were cut adrift last night between this post and Fort Moultrie on the ebb tide. I directed the navy guard-boat, under the command of Midshipman Wilkins, to accompany the torpedo-boat and locate operation. An 8-inch rifle was mounted last night in the caseate on the northwest face next southwest of the new sally-port. Weather too hazy for observation with the glass.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
