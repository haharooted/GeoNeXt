Fort Humboldt, Cal., May 11, 1863.

COLONEL: On the 30th of April a Government pack train, in charge of four men belonging to companies at Fort Gaston, was attacked by a band of Indians in ambush, numbering about twenty, some thirteen miles this side of Fort Gaston. Private Smith, of Company K, Second Infantry California Volunteers, was killed, and Corporal Smith [Agan], of the same company, was wounded. The Indians captured everything, including five Government mules, and all the effects of Lieutenants Stewart and Winchill. On the report coming in, detachments from Fort Gaston and Camp Curtis were sent out in pursuit of the Indians but returned without finding them. In pursuance of department orders, dated April 7, 1863, received last evening by the steamer Panama, Company E, Second Infantry, Captain Gibbs, and Company H of the same regment, commanded by Captain Hanna, have embarked on the steamer to proceed to Benicia. Private D. Squibb of Company E, goes with his company. Company I, Captain Theller, Second Infantry California Volunteers, is ordered here from Fort Gaston to replace Company H, at Fort Humboldt.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,
