HEADQUARTERS,
Camp Drum, October 17, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: On my arrival at this encampment I found the command, both officers and men, very uncomfortably situated. The encampment is stationed on a low, flat plain about half a mile from New San Pedro. The soil is sandy, but I am told mixes into mud after the rains begin to fall, until the roads are nearly or quite impassable. There is nothing to shelter us from the sea winds, which at times are very severe. Tents are often blow down and the atmosphere filled with sand. There is no such thing as keeping anything free from sand; desks, tables, and papers are constantly covered. The tents are old, and I am told leak very badly; indeed, I think they are totally unfit for service even in a better locality, and here they certainly would furnish a poor protection from the winter storms. If it is the intention of the department to keep troops at the present locality temporary quarters should, in my judgment, be at once constructed. I fear that I will find it difficult to keep this command in proper discipline unless quarters are built or a more comfortable location selected.

I have the honor to be, colonel, your obedient servant,

HARVEY LEE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Camp Drum.
