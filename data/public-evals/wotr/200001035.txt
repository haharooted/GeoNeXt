HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Big Shanty, Ga., June 14, 1864.

General BURBRIDGE,
Lexington, Ky.:

Your dispatch is received and is very satisfactory. Go on, raise the hue and cry, and don't mind the cost of money or horseflesh to hunt down every robber and guerrilla in your State. Make a clean job of it, and Morgan and all other such men will let Kentucky alone in all time to come. Seize fresh horses wherever they can be had, and leave the tired ones, giving a certificate for after settlement.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
