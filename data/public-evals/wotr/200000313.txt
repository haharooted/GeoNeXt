CAMP NEAR BATESVILLE, ARK.,

January 23, 1864.

Colonel R. R. LIVINGSTON.

Commanding District of Northeastern Arkansas:

COLONEL: I have the honor to make the following statement in regard to the scout commanded by me:

I started from camp at 2 a.m., January 19, with 43 enlisted men of Company I, Second Lieutenant Heath and 31 enlisted men of Company F, Eleventh Cavalry, Missouri Volunteers, and marched 8 miles on the road leading to Jacksonport, Ark., and was detained eight hours on account of high water; from thence to Grand Glaize, a distance of 20 miles, and found the boat 3 miles below that point. On the 20th, sent out a scout of 30 enlisted men under Lieutenant Heath, which captured James Rutherford, captain, acting quartermaster, at a distance of 3 miles from camp, and found on the person of said captain one Colt navy revolver and about $20,000 worth of receipts for corn.

Then left Fort Glaize the 21st marched as a guard for the boat, and encamped 6 miles below Jacksonport, nothing of interest transpiring through the day. 22nd, marched to Jacksonport, where we saw the boat, but could not hail it nor get to it on account of the ice in the river, and encamped for the night 13 miles west of Jacksonport, on the Batesville road. 23rd, left the Batesville road in order to head Salado Creek. After marching about 3 miles, met with about 20 Confederate soldiers; skirmished with them about 3 miles, capturing 1 lieutenant and 2 privates, 4 horses and equipments, 3 shot-guns, and 1 revolver, which were brought to Batesville a distance of 10 miles, and turned over to the provost-marshal.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM CASTLE,

Captain Company I, Eleventh Cavalry, Missouri Vols.
