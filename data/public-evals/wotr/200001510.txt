FORT SUMTER, February 9, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report the fleet the same as usual this morning; it is difficult to say whether there are four or five monitors. One shot fired at the fort yesterday. Lieutenant Kemper, 2 officers, and 60 men relieved Captain Colhoun last night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
