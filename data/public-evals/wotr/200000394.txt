HDQRS. FIRST CAVALRY, MISSOURI STATE MILITIA,
Warrensburg, Mo., January 25, 1864

[General E. B. BROWN:]

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of Captain Meredith's report of the Ridgway raid, also copies of Orders, Nos. 2,5,* and 18,* issued at these headquarters. I have directed Company I to take station, between Chapel Hill and Wellington, and in connection with Companies C at Chapel Hill, F at Wellington, thoroughly patrol and scout the western boundary of La Fayette. I have stationed Company I at Kingsville, on the western boundary, of this county, with instructions to thoroughly scout the western boundary of this county. I have hopes that these arrangements may serve to protect the people of this sub-district from incursions of Kansas troops and Red Legs. No other news of interest.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES McFERRAN,

First Cav., Commanding Sub-Dist. of Central Dist. of Mo.
