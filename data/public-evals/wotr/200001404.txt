FRANKLIN, LA., January 29, 1864.

(Received 4 p. m.)

Brigadier-General STONE,

Chief of Staff:

The effective force now here is 4,000-2,000 infantry, four batteries of field artillery (eighth guns), and two batteries of heavy artillery (eight guns), and about 500 serviceable cavalry. This force can hold this position against any equal force of the enemy. To hold the position against any force which the enemy might bring will require about 4,000 infantry and two field batteries. I think that in any event the cavalry force here should be increased to 2,000 effective, and that at least one gun-boat of very light draught should be at Franklin.

If it will be impossible to increase the cavalry and furnish the gun-boat, then I recommend that if this place be threatened by the enemy in large force the command be withdrawn so far that the gun-boats now in Berwick Bay can aid it. Any point below Bisland will fulfill this condition, but I recommend that this place be held, and that the force be increased by the cavalry and gun-boat already specified. I have seen no indication of an immediate attack by the enemy, but I think his movement will be governed by ours. Our troops here are in.

I should mention that more than 1,000 of the men ar entitled to furloughs as veterans, as also in one field battery of four guns. These losses should be made good here as soon as they take place. There is on colored regiment here that I have not counted.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.
