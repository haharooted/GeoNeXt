CHARLESTON, S. C., May 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General Finegan, with two battalions (600 strong) of his brigade, left here to-day about 12 o'clock for Richmond. The enemy has renewed his demonstration on James Island, and is firing rapidly now. I shall retain the Twentieth Regiment until to-morrow. It is very important that I should have a few more troops. Can I get any?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
