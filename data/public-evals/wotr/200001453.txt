[Indorsement.]

Let Major Thompson be ordered to send the two companies of engineers at Aransas to Colonel Hodge by the first opportunity. It was intended that they should have been so sent upon the arrival of the company of colored Rhole Island artillery, from Pass Cavallo, at Arkansas.

Major-General, Commanding.
