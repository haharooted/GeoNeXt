HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,
Buzzard Roost, May 10, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps, Army of the Cumberland:

Prepare your corps for movement to-night, with three days' rations, and as much more as you can conveniently carry. This does not imply that the troops now in front are to be withdrawn until the order to move is given.

Respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Have all of your wagons filled also. They may not be taken though.
