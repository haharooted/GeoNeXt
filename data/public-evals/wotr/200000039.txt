HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,
In the Field, May 9, 1864-10.30 a. m.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: We met on emerging from the gorge one brigade of cavalry (rebel), who were endeavoring to get possession of the gap. Prisoners report that one regiment, Fourth Georgia Cavalry, is coming up the Pocket road to the Furnace, and that Wheeler, with a cavalry force, is trying to cross the mountain from the north, the three forces to form a junction at the west end of the gap. We have been a little too quick for them. It is necessary, however, that the guard left with the train be vigilant and have pickets well out on all the roads. There are enough of them to whip any enemy, if they do not permit themselves to be surprised. I think that Kilpatrick will attend to any cavalry that crosses the mountain from the north.

Yours, truly,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
