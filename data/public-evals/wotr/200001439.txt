HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS, &C.,

Little Rock, April 13, 1864.

Brigadier General N. KIMBALL,

Commanding Detachment Seventh Army Corps:

GENERAL: The steamer Adams, loaded with Government stores for Pine Bluff to be sent to Camden by train, ran into the steamer Chippewa about 20 miles below Little Rock last night and was sunk, supposed to have been occasioned by the carelessness of the pilot. A portion of the ammunition and quartermaster's stores were saved, and duplicate invoices of what is lost will be sent as soon as possible on the steamer Chippewa.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
