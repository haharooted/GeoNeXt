LEXINGTON, KY., June 12, 1864.

Brigadier General H. B. CARRINGTON,

Louisville, Ky.:

I have no latter information from any quarter. Colonel Weatherford, Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry, has reached Lebanon from Burkesville. I have ordered him to hold it to the last man, and keep a good lookout toward Bardstown and Danville. Am expecting the return of scouts sent to Frankfort yesterday forenoon.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
