FEBRUARY 16, 1864. -Affair at Fairfield, N. C.

Report of Major General John J. Peck, U. S. Army.

HDQRS. ARMY AND DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA, New Berne, N. C., February 23, 1864.

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that General Wessells, commanding Sub-district of the Albermarle, dispatched the army gunboat Foster on the 16th to the Alligator River upon a reconnaissance. Her crew was re-enforced by Lieutenant Helm and 30 men fo the One hundred and first Pennsylvania Volunteers. Hearing that the Spencer Rangers were quartered at Fairfield, Captain McLaughlin proceeded in two launches, surprised the outpost, and captured the whole company, consisting of Captain Spencer, 1 lieutenant, and 26 privates. Much property was taken. This enterprise was conducted in a heavy snow-storm, and entitles all concerned to the highest praise. Another proof is added of the value of our army gun-boats.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
