THIBODEAUX, LA., January 21, 1864-5 p.m.

(Received 5.10 p.m.)

Brigadier General C. P. STONE, Chief of Staff:

A small party of Vincent's cavalry came down and tore up the track near Tigerville night of 19th instant. Not much damage done, and has been repaired. Three men of the Ninetieth Regiment at Bayou Boeuf went outside the lines last night and are supposed to be captured by said party. I have parties out from Napoleonville and Bayou Boeuf and hope to get them. One guerrilla has been captured and is in jail here. General Emory telegraphs for the steamer C. P. Stone to send on a reconnaissance. I send her, but she is needed here. Is she to be under his orders?

E. L. MOLINEUX,

Colonel, Commanding.
