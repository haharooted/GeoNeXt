Brigadier General E. M. McCOOK,
Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to advise you that it is his intention to push forward his left to-day, and he desires you to make a demonstration with your command on the direct Dalton road, on the road from Varnell's Station to Dalton, on the east side of the railroad. The general desires you to feel the enemy on all these roads. Keep yourself informed of the position of the infantry left, and communicate frequently with these headquarters. The general intends to advance the infantry left so as to cover the road from Varnell's Station to Dalton, on this side of the railroad, some time to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
