LITTLE ROCK, ARK., April 16, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel WAUGH,

Commanding, Clarksville, Ark.:

COLONEL: Captain Clowry, superintendent of telegraph, informs me that the line is down above your post. Why can you not keep it up? You have 50 mounted men and 180 foot. Fifty men should be able to protect the line above you. This line is our chief dependence and must be kept in order. I have ordered Colonel Fuller to send a force to you for the purpose of repairing the line. You will give his force every aid, and you must keep the line in repair. Hang or shoot every scoundrel whom you can find who has interfered or may interfere with the line. The rebels in your vicinity are not numerous; you ought to be able with your force to drive them away.

NATHAN KIMBALL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
