HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, January 21, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel BISHOP,

Commanding, Fayetteville:

Colonel Phelps dispatches from Berryville on the 18th that Colonel Gunning with 400 men was 40 miles below there. You will see from this that there is quite a force west of you. You will instruct Captain Galloway not to engage a largely superior force unless it becomes necessary for his own safety, but maneuver until he can communicate with the other forces in that vicinity and make a joint attack with them. You may strengthen him in your own discretion.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
