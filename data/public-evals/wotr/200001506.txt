[Second indorsements.]

JUNE 9, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

I recommend that theses troops be mustered into United States service for the period of twenty months from the 1st of November, 1863, and that they be paid from date of muster-that is, November 1, 1863.

The organization for muster-in must conform to the recruiting regulations for U. S. volunteer service, as that is required by the act approved July 17, 1862 . It is proper for me to call attention to the fact that it will require about $350,000 to pay these men from 1st of last November to 1st of July. Whether such a demand would embarrass the Pay Department or not, I am unable to state. On some of these papers, under date of April 7, 1864, the Paymaster-General reports difficulty in getting money to pay the troops already in the U. S. service.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
