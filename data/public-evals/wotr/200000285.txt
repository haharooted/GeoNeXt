HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,
Matagorda Peninsula, Tex., January 25, 1864

Lieutenant Colonel W. B. SCATES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Thirteenth Army Corps:

Since my second visit to Indianola, and the information now received and which takes me by surprise, that I am to fortify and hold myself strictly on the defensive, and that some of my troops will be taken away. I feel more than ever the need of a competent officer of engineers. There is not an officer in this whole command who knows anything about fortifications and keeping engineer troops properly at their tasks. The civil engineer whom Major Houstoin has here is entirely incompetent as a military engineer to plan fortifications and work men on them so as to get a half task out of them; he is competent as a topographer and draughtsman, but is slow, and is reported as being too fond of whisky. I hope a competent officer will be at once sent.

Very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA

Major-General
