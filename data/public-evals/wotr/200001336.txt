Numbers 16. Report of Lieutenant Colonel James G. Hughes, Thirty-ninth New York Infantry.

HDQRS. THIRTY-NINTH REGIMENT NEW YORK VOLS.,
February 9, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report the part this regiment (Thirty-ninth New York Volunteers) took in the reconnaissance of the 6th day of February, 1864:

The regiment left camp on the 6th instant at 7 a. m., with 18 officers and 390 men under my command. I detailed Captains Baer and Schwickardi to command all the old soldiers of the regiment (100 in number) as skirmishers to cross the Rapidan River, which they did in gallant style, driving the enemy from their rifle-pits and capturing 15 prisoners. The regiment was the second to form line on the opposite side of the river. It marched in line of battle to within gunshot of the enemy's skirmishers. About 12 m. I changed front to the right and took position on the Morton's Ford road. About 5 p. m. I was ordered to form line of battle to the right of General Hays' headquarters, under a heavy fire of the enemy, which was done very promptly considering that the men under my command were never under fire before and not two months in service.

My loss was 1 enlisted man killed, 17 wounded, and 17 missing. Lieutenant L. Derndinger was severely wounded in the left arm while on the skirmish line.

I take pleasure in making honorable mention of First Lieutenant John McE. Hyde, acting adjutant of the regiment, who rendered me excellent service on the field; also Captains Baer and Schwickardi and Lieutenant Derndinger, for gallantry; also Chief Bugler Anton Rang, for bravery on the skirmish line. I recrossed the Rapidan at 1 a. m. next day.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES G. HUGHES,

Lieutenant Colonel, Commanding Thirty-ninth New York Volunteers.
