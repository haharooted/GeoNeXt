Colonel J. STEINBERGER, U. S. Army,

Commanding Fort Walla Walla, Wash., Ter.:

COLONEL: I have respectfully to request that you will order a detachment of twenty-five or thirty mounted men to proceed to Grande Ronde Valley for the purpose of arresting certain refractory Indians who are creating a serious disturbance among the settlers in that valley. These Indians belong to the Umatilla Indina Reservation, but do not recognize their treaty obligations. They have refused to allow white men to settle in the valley, and have already driven away several men by threats of violence. Should those Indians be permitted to remain where they are at present congregated, difficulties of a serious character must occur between them and the white settlers. If two or three of the leaders of the party are captured at once and placed in confinement in the guard-house at Fort Walla Walla the whole affair may be checked and no further trouble in that quarter be apprehended. I have also respectfully to request that when the infantry detachment at the reservation is relieved a detachment of twenty mounted men may take their place, to remain permanently, for the preservation of peace and good order on the reservation. The great influx of travel to the mines directly through the reservation causes much dissatisfaction in the minds of the Indians and renders it absolutely necessary that a small force be kept constantly at the agency.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. BARNHART,

U. S. Indian Agent, Umatilla Reservation.

Approved.

WM. H. RECTOR

Superintendent Indian Affairs.
