HEADQUARTERS,
Fort Walla Walla, October 15, 1862.

R. BAILEY, Esq.,

Secretary, &c., Lewiston, Wash. Ter.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 11th instant on the part of the citizens of Lewiston, and referring to their requirement of troops and arms for the ensuing winter. Impressed with the belief that preparations should be made in that portion of the district for the defense your letter suggests, [and] by other and frequent reports received at this post, I have some time since represented the necessity to the proper authority. Judge William Kelly, assistant adjutant-general of the Territorial militia, near Walla Walla, has in his charge about 250 stand of muskets, and during the month of August last he was requested by myself to make requisition on the Governor for 100,000 rounds of ammunition for that arm. At the same time, and in view of the contingency your letter now refers, requisition was made by myself for a supply of ordnance and ordnance stores for the garrison. Since the receipt of your letter yesterday, and in furtherance of your request for my assistance [in] the procuration of arms, I have written to the Governor of Washington Territory commending your memorial to his earnest attention and indorsing your views. Referring to the posting of troops at or near Lewiston, which forms a part of your communication, I have officially forwarded a copy thereof to the headquarters of the District of Oregon for the consideration of the commanding general, I am advised of the early visit of Brigadier-General Alvord, in company with the superintendent of Indian affairs for Washington Territory, to this post, en route to your city and Lapwai Agency, and reserve a representation of your requests for a personal interview with these officers.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUSTUS STEINBERGER,

Colonel First Washington Territory Infantry, Commanding.
