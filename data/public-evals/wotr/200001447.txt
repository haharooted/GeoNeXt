FORT LARAMIE, April 10, 1864.

Colonel J. M. CHIVINGTON:

General Mitchell telegraphs information received that Indians stole 175 horses near Denver and directs me to co-operate with you.

Is it true? When and where? If so, call on Major Mackey, at Halleck, for all troops he can spare, and telegraph me what help I can send from here.

WM. O. COLLINS,

Lieutenant-Colonel Eleventh Ohio Cavalry.
