HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., May 29, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Forty rebels crossed the stage road near the California House on the 27th instant, moving north. I think it important that Houston, in Texas County, should be occupied by troops. Shelby's command is north of the Boston Mountains that I can learn.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
