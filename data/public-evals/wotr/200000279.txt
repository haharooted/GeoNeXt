HDQRS. DISTRICT OF NORTHEASTERN ARKANSAS,
Batesville, January 23, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER, DETACH, 11TH MO. CAV.:

CAPTAIN: The colonel commanding directs me to thank, you and through you to thank your officers and men, for the promptness displayed in getting under arms upon the occasion of the false alarm at 2 p.m. to-day occasioned by the unsoldierly conduct of the men of Captain Castle's command in discharging their fire-arms without orders. We trust and believe that the Eleventh will always be found equally prompt on future occasions.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. FILLEBROWN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
