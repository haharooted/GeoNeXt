CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. B. DICKSON;

Rebels in Lancaster at 2 p. m. This I think reliable. Our men in pursuit, in hopes they will overtake them to-night. Rebels and their stock much worn down. Many of them arrived with nothing but revolvers. Would it not be best to keep them divided? We have every main in pursuit that could be mounted and armed. Don't see how they could get to Mount Sterling, but if it is thought best will send courier and order them to that place.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
