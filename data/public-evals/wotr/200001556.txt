HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH, Folly Island, S. C., July 27,1 864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: On the 25th instant I sent out to the fleet, requesting to be furnished with some clock-work torpedoes. In reply, Captain Green, commanding naval forces before Charleston, informed me that he had none and knew nothing about them, but would forward my letter to Admiral Dahlgren at Hilton Head. I require these torpedoes to destroy the boom around Sumter, which is found, on examination, to exist on the right face, as well as on the right flank and gorge; until the destruction of which no mines can be brought properly in contact with the fort. I address you on the subject, thinking you may be able to obtain these torpedoes for me.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

A. SCHIMMELFENNIG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.
