Captain J. E. CURTISS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Numbers 9. Report of Lieutenant Colonel George W. Thompson, One hundred and fifty-second New York Infantry.

HEADQUARTERS 152nd NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,
Near Stevensburg, Va., February 8, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of this command in the late expedition across the Rapidan:

The command left camp at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 6th instant, and proceeded via Stevensburg to a point opposite Morton's Ford, on the Rapidan River; formed line of battle on the left of the brigade, remained there about one hour, them moved forward in line about 100 rods, where we remained until about 7 o'clock p. m., at which time we moved by the right flank across the river at the ford, and proceeded in a southwesterly direction about 150 rods, and again formed line of battle, and remained in position until about 12 p. m. The battalion was then deployed as skirmishers, and commenced advancing, when we were ordered to and did reform and return to the north side of the river, leaving Captain Hamilton with 50 men on the island near the ford. The balance of the battalion proceeded to the position last occupied before crossing the river. Captain Hamilton and the men left with him remained on and near the island during picket duty until 3. 30 p. m. yesterday, when he was relieved and rejoined the regiment. Last evening, at 7 o'clock, we left this last position and returned to camp, arriving about 9 p. m.

Very respectfully,

G. W. THOMPSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
