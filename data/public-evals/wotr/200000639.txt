Saint Louis, Mo., May 30, 1864

General FISK,

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

Your dispatches received. Pursue your even way with vigorous circumspection. You cannot look for any troops from here at present therefore must prepare provisional militia. Captain Reed, having been assigned to provost duty, must be replaced as I think Colonel Sanderson will be able to send you men who will answer your purpose fully as well.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
