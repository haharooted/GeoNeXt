Brigadier General G. W. CULLUM, Chief of Staff.

Numbers 2. Report of Captain C. Regnier, commanding steamer Levi.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,
Charleston, W. Va., February 10, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward by Colonel Jones the report of the captain of the Levi, who was captured by the rebels on the 3rd of this month. All my cavalry returned to their quarters without success, after having pursued the enemy for five days.

I would respectfully ask that the boats be placed under my control, in order to regulate the hour of their departure, and avoid by this means all kinds of disaster.

I am, sir, very respectfully, yours, &c.,

A. N. DUFFIE,

General.
