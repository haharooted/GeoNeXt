HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES ON THE RIO GRANDE,
Brownsville, Tex., January [27?], 1864.

Brigadier General CHARLES P. STONE, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: After three weeks' trial, I am satisfied that our line of communication via Point Isabel is not the correct one under existing circumstances. The steamers carrying supplies to this post are of such a draught that they cannot get nearer than 5 miles to Point Isabel, where they anchor and transfer the charge to river boats to be carried to the point.

These smaller boats approach to within 50 feet of shore, a wharf having been constructed that length. From here goods are carried by wagons to Brownsville, it requiring two days to make the trip each way, and water being found at only one point on the route. Water is also carried back by these teams for men as well as animals at Point Isabel.

What I propose to do is to build a wharf at Brazos Island and establish the depots there, bridge Boca Chica, and transport all supplies by wagons along the beach to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and shipping there on rive boats for Brownsville. If is 9 miles from the wharf at Brazos Island to the mouth of the river, the road along the beach hard an in fine condition. For a few days each month this road might be impassable, but I propose to construct another road inside of the sand hills that will be protected in all water. By this route we shall have but 9 miles of land transportation and can unload much more rapidly than by the present way. The garrison at Point Isabel, will, of course, be contained, but a portion of the Sixteenth Corps d'Afrique will be moved to the mouth of the river as a guard, and to handle stores. I inclose a sketch that will give you an idea of the new route.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General, Commanding.

The sketch was not ready; will send it by next mail.
