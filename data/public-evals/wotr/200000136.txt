The Richmond Sentinel of March 5 (yesterday) has been received, which announced the capturing at King and Queen of a part of Dahlgren's party, reported 90 men, and that Colonel Dahlgren was killed in the skirmish. I fear the account is true. The paper will be sent you to-morrow.

GEO. G. MEADE,
Major-General.

Major H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
