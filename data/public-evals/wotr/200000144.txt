FORT MONROE, VA., March 3, 1864-8 p. m. (Received 8. 40 a. m., 4th.)

The following dispatch received from my aide at Fort Magruder, who went out with my forces to New Kent Court-House:

Arrived all safe. General Kilpatrick is here, having lost less than 150 men, among whom were Colonels Dahlgren, [Major] Cooke, and Litchfield. Colonels Dahlgren and [Major] Cooke are supposed to the prisoners; Litchfield either wounded or killed. Went within outer line of fortifications; was engaged until dark with the enemy. Colonel Spear will be in to-morrow.
