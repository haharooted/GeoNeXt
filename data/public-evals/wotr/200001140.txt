HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,
Mesilla, September 9, 1862.

Captain E. B. WILLIS,

First Infantry California Volunteers, Hart's Mill:

To provide against the probability of an attack upon your post you will take immediate steps to place the machinery of Hart's Mill in a condition that will enable you in the shortest possible time to remove two sets of buhrstones, with the requisite running gear. Every effort must be made in case the enemy advances to remove these to the main body of the troops in the district. But you will not permit the property you remove, nor any that you leave behind, in case you evacuate your post, to fall into the hands of the enemy in a condition that will be of service to him; that is, you will utterly destroy all facilities for making flour at Hart's Mill when you are compelled to abandon it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
