SUMTER, January 22, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that Captain Burgess, 5 officers, and 101 men, from Twenty-fifth South Carolina Volunteers, relieved Captain Allston, 6 offices, and 100 men, from Twenty-seventh South Carolina Volunteers. There is 1 officer wanting to make up the regular detail. A steam tug was seen unusually near Fort Moultrie last night, retiring only at daylight. One shot fired yesterday, which missed. The water-boat was not down. We stand in much need of the lanterns for which requisitions has already been made.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. T. MILES,

Captain, Commanding Post.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
