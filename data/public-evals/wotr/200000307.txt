SPRINGFIELD, MO., January 1, 1864

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

It is respectfully suggested that the economy and good of the service would be promoted by having two well disciplined and drilled companies of infantry assigned to this district and post for provost guard, and to garrison Fort Numbers 1, when Major Rabb's men of the Second Missouri Artillery leave, which will be required before long, unless this force is to receive its outfit here; using two squadrons of cavalry for this duty seems to involve an unnecessary expense.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
