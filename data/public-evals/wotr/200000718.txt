PALMYRA, MO., May 30, 1864

Brigadier-General FISK:

Acting on your telegram of the 28th instant, I sent a lieutenant and 50 men into Pike County. They started yesterday morning at daylight. Major Ledergerber furnished guides Saturday afternoon.

I gave the officer in charge orders to remain out five days should he find work to occupy that time. Shall I not wait till those men return?

C. H. GREGORY,

Major, Commanding Detachment.
