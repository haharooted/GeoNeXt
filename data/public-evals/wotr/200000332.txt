Jefferson City, January 22, 1864.

Colonel JAMES McFERRAN,

Commanding Third Sub-District, Warrensburg:

COLONEL: Please make a rigid inquiry as to the authority for believing that the camp and force reported as being north of Chapel Hill by Lieutenant Couch is Blunt's or Todd's guerrillas. I should not be surprised if you learned that it was Union thieves and not rebels. You will probably find it necessary to keep your command in the field, and the district of country on the west side of La Fayette thoroughly and constantly scouted.

I am, truly, yours,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
