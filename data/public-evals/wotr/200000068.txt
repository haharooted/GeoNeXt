Near North Point of Rocky Face, May 10, 1864-12 m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Tunnel Hill:

I made a demonstration on the enemy early this morning, and found him apparently in about the same force as last evening, certainly not stronger. I then commenced to withdraw my troops very slowly and quietly. The movement is now nearly completed, and with entire success. My main force had been withdrawn about two hours before the enemy made any effort to follow, and only a small force has appeared in my front since that time. My troops are now moving into the new position indicated by Captain Poe, viz, covering the passes through Rocky Face Ridge, near this place. I have established a line of pickets along the ridge connecting with General Newton. McCook is operating upon my left and left front. He has encountered only a small force of rebel cavalry. There was considerable movement of the enemy in my front during the night. My scouts were divided in opinion as to its character. Pretended deserters from the enemy report a movement of troops from Dalton to the works in my front during the night. I believe they were sent by the enemy to tell me a lie. The enemy's artillery was still in position and playing when we withdrawn, and the skirmishing was quite brisk during the early morning, yet I am of the opinion that some troops were withdrawn during the night. Our loss this morning was very slight. My trains are in rear of Tunnel Hill Gap. I am having rations issued, ammunition replenished, and will be ready to execute your orders at once. Stoneman will reach Varnell's with only one of his brigades to-night. The other will be up to-morrow. I presume it will be desirable to give him instructions to-night after the results of this day are known. Will you please give me any orders you may have from him. If not otherwise ordered he will move directly to me.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
