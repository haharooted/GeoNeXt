Admiral J. A. DAHLGREN, U. S. Navy,
Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

ADMIRAL: I have received one case which I believe contains one torpedo clock. I wanted six of them. Please also to send a description of the manner of winding them up and setting them to run a certain time. I propose to go to Morris Island this evening to try these mines, provided the preparations be completed, as I ordered. I think it will be necessary to make use of a monitor form which to float the rafts down upon the fort. Will you please give the necessary orders to aid in the enterprise, provided the senior officer there has not already that power. I shall leave this evening or to-night.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
