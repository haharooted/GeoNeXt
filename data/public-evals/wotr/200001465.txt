PINE BLUFF, May 31, 1864

Lieutenant Colonel W. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: Fagan's communication sent to-day by flag of truce, was headed as follows:

Headquarters Middle Sub-District Arkansas, Monticello, Ark., May 29, 1864.

I think there is no doubt but that his headquarters are at Monticello, and that the greater portion of the enemy's cavalry are in that vicinity. I believe Marmaduke is between Bayou Bartholomew and the Mississippi. Cabell and Dockery are with Fagan.

POWELL CLAYTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
