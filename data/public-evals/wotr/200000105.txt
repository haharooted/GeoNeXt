Numbers 1. Report of Brigadier General Robert O. Tyler, U. S. Army.

HEADQUARTERS TYLER'S DIVISION, Fairfax Court-House, Va., February 23, 1864-9 p. m.

I have the honor to report that a detachment of 125 men of the Second Massachusetts Cavalry, and 25 men of the Sixteenth New York Cavalry, under command of Captain J. S. Reed, Second Massachusetts Cavalry, encountered, on the 21st instant, in the vicinity of Circleville Post-Office, 70 of Mosby's men, whom they defeated with severe loss to them. On their return, within 2 miles of Dranesville, on the Leesburg turnpike, they were ambuscaded by a force of between 200 and 300 men, under command of Mosby. Captain Reed's command fought well, but were finally driven toward the Potomac, in the vicinity of Muddy Branch. On receipt of the intelligence, a large force went immediately in pursuit, without, however, overtaking the enemy, who had ten hours the start, and the pursuit beyond Goose Creek was abandoned. Our loss was 10 killed and 7 wounded. Among the former, I regret to say, way Captain Reed, a brave and noble soldier. About 60 of the detachment are yet unaccounted for. A report will be sent by mail to-morrow.

R. O. TYLER,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
