CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

Giltner's forces crossed pike between this and Nicholasville a few minutes since, going east. Our picket brought in one prisoner, but he appears to be very ignorant. Can't get much out of him that is reliable; he thinks Giltner has 1,500 men.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
