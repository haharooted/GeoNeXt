HDQRS. DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 22, 1864

Lieutenant H. GRATHEER:

The general commanding directs that you remain at Ozark until you receive fifteen days' rations which start to you to-night. Upon receiving the rations you will proceed, with all your available force and as little camp and garrison equipage, as a field campaign in the winter service will justify, to join Captain Human, commanding First Battalion, Eighth Missouri State Militia Cavalry, in the field, Arkansas. You will take a guide from Ozark, or procure one on the road, to guide you to Captain Human's command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. D. HUBBARD,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
