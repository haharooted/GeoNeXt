[Fourth indorsement.]

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,
June 20, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

Operators can be supplied from the enlisted men now in this district. The line runs through ha part of the country entirely ours. I traverse it without a guard; single men and officers pass between this and Saint Augustine without apprehension. A loyal population is rapidly setting on the east side of the Saint John's. These men would promptly arrest any one from the rebel army. Our picket-boats and the gun-boats on the river make it a difficult matter for any to pass from the west to the east side of the Saint John's. On the whole, I consider the line as safe certainly as the one between New York and Philadelphia.

The aid of such a communication would be immense to the general commanding district in the ordinary administration. If the line cost $20,000 it should be made.

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
