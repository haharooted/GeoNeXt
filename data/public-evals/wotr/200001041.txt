LEXINGTON, KY., June 12, 1864.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

Courier just from General Burbridge. The general left Paris at 10 p. m., and expected to attack rebels at Cynthiana at daybreak. Please obtain information by scouts for me where a force of ours, ordered to vacate Irvine come here, via Richmond, is. It should have been at Richmond yesterday afternoon. I heard from Richmond yesterday forenoon; all quiet there; our troops not seen. Colonel Weatherford is at Lebanon with Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry. His orders are to hold Lebanon and keep a lookout toward Danville and Bardstown. My information from Louisville is that ample re- enforcements will be furnished. I shall try to get some to you as soon as possible. In the mean time please keep your scouts well out, and send me any information of importance.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
