Batesville, January 26, 1864.

Major WILSHIRE,

126th Illinois Infantry, Commanding Transport Pocahontas,

Near Jacksonport, Ark.:

MAJOR: The colonel commanding directs me to inform you that he has just received a dispatch from Little Rock, Ark., by the hands of Captain Robertson, Third Regiment Arkansas Cavalry, who came through from that place with an escort of 50 men of his regiment. Lieutenant-Colonel Black, Third Missouri Cavalry, with his command, is at Little Rock, Ark., and there are no Federal troops at Searcy. Captain Robertson had a fight with the rebels at that place. The colonel commanding directs that you turn over the stores that were intended for Colonel Black at Searcy to his quartermaster, and inform him as soon as possible what progress you are making toward getting the stores up the river.

I remain, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. FILLEBROWN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
