[Indorsement.]

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ROLLA,
Rolla, Mo., March 3, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded, for the information of the department commander. I would here take occasion to remark that the detachment at Waynesville, Mo., has always exhibited creditable zeal in ridding the section of guerrillas and hors thieves, and deserves the praise and confidence of those in authority.

JOS. A. EPSTEIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding District.
