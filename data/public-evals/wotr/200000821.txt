CHARLESTON, S. C., June 14, 1864.

Major-General Foster has recently assumed command of U. S. forces on this coast; is now on or near Folly Island. I suspect he will attempt some enterprise against us. A large transport landed troops on Folly Island yesterday. Spies and recent deserters have no doubt informed them of our weakness. Neither of the artillery companies ordered to me by Special Orders, Numbers 105, current series, from Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, have arrived; nor have I yet a man of the South Carolina reserves. Three artillery companies have been disbanded on James Island, and I cannot supply their places. This is a serious loss just at this time. This place will be in great danger if the enemy concentrates his troops on this coast against it. Can anything be done to aid me? Cannot General Johnston send me re-enforcements in a pressing emergency?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General B. BRAGG.
