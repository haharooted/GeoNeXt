HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,
Camp at Snake Creek Gap, May 9, 1864-5.30 a. m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I inclose dispatch+ just received from Stevenson at Decatur. Roddey it seems has crossed the Tennessee River with about 5,000 men, estimated, and is endeavoring to cut our lines of communication. Gresham must be in the vicinity of Athens and Pulaski, and Force in Clinton or near there, though I have not heard from them in several days. I am running [pushing] through Snake Creek Gap. My advance commanded the debouch on the eastern side last night and was seven miles from Resaca. I have parked my trains near the west entrance and left two brigades to guard them. No news from Garrard.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
