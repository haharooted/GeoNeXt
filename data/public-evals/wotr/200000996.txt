HILTON HEAD, June 7, 1864.

General HALLECK:

GENERAL: I wrote you a private letter this morning, but as I have a moment before the steamer leaves, I wish to add that if you desire me to act with caution in any demonstration that you desire me to make, that I will change the point of attack from Charleston to Savannah, where there will be less liability to disaster in case we do not succeed. I think I can make an attempt on Savannah without much risk.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
