HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Hilton Head, S. C., July 7, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,
Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 25 in regard to the order of Colonel Hallowell, Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers. I feel very much mortified that this thing should happen, and all I can do is to offer and explanation. The whole affairs was a misconception on the part of one of my staff officers, who was not authorized to issue the order to Colonel Hallowell that he did. The officers of the two regiments, the Fifty-fifth and Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, in view of the very bad condition of the men of their regiments, who were in want of their pay, were extremely anxious to take some steps by which it might be remedied. I therefore consented to permit Colonel Hallowell to go to New York on leave of absence, with permission to ask leave to visit Washington. An order, instead of the requisite leave of absence, was given thought a misunderstanding. I am well aware of the prohibition of allowing officers to visit Washington, and have always strictly observed it. Colonel Hallowell has been ordered to return immediately to his regiment.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
