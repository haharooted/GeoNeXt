CAMP ANDERSON, September 8, 1862-12. 30 p. m.

Captain DOUGLAS:

SIR: The Diggers have cleaned us out and taken our mules and packs and wounded Sergeant Connell. About 6 a. m. as we were going up the hill at the head of Redwood, some four miles from the Weaver trail, and were within 200 yards of the ridge, some seventy-five or eighty Diggers opened a fire upon us from behind a high ledge of rocks, wounding Sergeant Connell in the foot, shooting my mule from under me and two of the pack-mules, and Shepherd's riding mule. The hill being covered with high fern probably saved the lives of half the party. I found I could not drive them from their stronghold, and I ordered the men to fall back into the timber, some 500 yards down the hill, hoping they would come out from their cover. Having gained the timber we took a position and after remaining some time we discovered they were endeavoring to surround us; and having one man wounded and all our provisions gone, the men having packed their haversacks and blankets, I concluded to return to Anderson, at which place I have just arrived, almost dead, having come all the way down Redwood Creek. The men are all used up. I send Oliver with this dispatch, thinking you might send a messenger to Rocky Ridge to advise Captain Theller's and Lieutenant Morton's parties. Sergeant Connell is not badly wounded, but the ball is in his foot and very painful. I write this private letter at present but will make a full report as soon as I am able to do so.

Yours, in haste,

WM. H. NOYES,

Lieutenant, Second Infantry California Volunteers.
