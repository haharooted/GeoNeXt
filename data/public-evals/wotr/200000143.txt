HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, Fort Monroe, March 30, 1864.

Rear-Admiral DAHLGREN:

DEAR SIR: I have received the most positive assurances from Judge Ould upon two points that may interest you. First, that the statements in the Richmond papers of any indignities to the remains of your son are false; that they were decently and properly buried under the direction of an officer of equal rank in the Confederate service. Secondly, I have the most positive assurances from him that you shall receive the remains of your son by next flag-of truce boat.

I beg leave to add my own assurances that the moment Colonel Dahlgren a remains arrive at this point they shall be safely and most speedily forwarded to you.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
