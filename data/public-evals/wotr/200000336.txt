GENERAL: I have the honor to state that I have no information of any further raids by Kansas men. There has been some stealing in this county, believed to be by local thieves. We are using every diligence to ferret them out, and have been successful in arresting some of them. No other news of interest.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
