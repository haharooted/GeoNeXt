INDEPENDENCE, May 30, 1864

Brigadier General C. B. FISK,

Saint Joseph:

Eighty-three bushwhackers crossed Grand River, going north, on the 27th of April; have several brushes with them. They broke up in small bands and are scattered through the country. We are scouting in every direction after them. I do not think any of them heave crossed the Missouri River yet. Other bands reported crossing.

JAMES H. FORD,

Colonel,&c.
