Mesilla, October 19, 1862.

Don JOSE MARIA URANGA,

Prefect, &c., El Paso, Mexico:

A reply to your communication of the 8th instant, advising me of your authority to comply with the terms of the extradition treaty, celebrated between the Governments of Mexico and of the United States of America, has been delayed until I should receive a copy thereof. I have the honor now to apprise you that I am empowered, as superior military chief commanding in this district, to comply with such demands for the surrender of criminals in accordance with the terms of said treaty as you shall make upon me. The difficulties in the way of compliance with this convention of our respective Governments which you seem to anticipate do not suggest themselves to my mind. If you will be so good as to appriseure, I shall be much pleased to adopt proper measures to obviate them. In the meantime the responsibility will be assumed on my part of surrendering to your demand persons duly charged in accordance with the terms of said treaty with the larceny of property of less value than $25. One such case, that of Nicholas Flores, is now within my authority. On the 3rd instant I had the honor to address you a note in regard to him. As no reply has been received from you the note may have miscarried. He will be delivered upon your requisition.

Trusting to find you disposed to exert your authority in every way toward the suppressing of the disorders which unfortunately prevail upon the frontiers of our territories, I am, sir, with much respect, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
