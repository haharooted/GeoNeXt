Baton Rouge, La., January 19, 1864.

Captain SELFRIDGE,

U. S. Navy, Commanding Station:

DEAR SIR: I have received information that the enemy have again crossed the Atchafalaya, in force unknown, but that 50 visited Waterloo on Friday; also that Jackson is their headquarters, this side, and that their force is very considerable, and that the design to cross from the west to the east bank is still entertained by them. I deem it my duty to inform you that the longer presence here of the Conestoga and General Price does [not] seem necessary.

With my thanks for your great promptness and Captain Richardson's in coming to co-operate with me, I remain, with high respect,

your obedient servant,

P. ST. GEO. COOKE,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
