FORT SUMTER, February 2, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the enemy fired four 30-pounder Parrott shots at us yesterday, 1 of which missed, and 2 last night, which missed. Forty-two-pounder, cracked band, was placed on the berm ready for shipment to the city at 7.30 this morning. The enemy opened with two 30-pounders, and afterward with a 300-pounder and four monitors and a 100-pounder Parrott from Wagner, at a blockade-runner ashore on Sullivan's Island. Several shells have exploded in her. Firing still continues.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.

Lieutenant BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
