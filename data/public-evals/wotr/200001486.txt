CAMP FILLMORE, COLO. TER., May 28, 1864

Lieutenant J. S. MAYNARD,

A. A. A. G., Dist. of Colorado, Denver City, Colo. Ter.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that I have just received from Major Wynkoop an order for this company to march without delay and report to the commanding officer at Fort Lyon for duty. The major says:

I have received information that Lieutenant Eayre's command have nearly all been killed by the Cheyenne Indians at some place over on Smoky Hill Fork. I have already used all the means in my power to ascertain the correctness of the report and know not what moment I may be obliged to start with a large command to his assistance.

For the following reasons I cannot comply as promptly as I could wish with the foregoing order, viz: I have not a single team or wagon with which to transport the company and its stores, but am advised by Captain Backus that the company teams would leave Denver on the 25th instant. I will march as soon as transportation arrives unless orders are received to the contrary. Two sections of the battery left this camp on Wednesday, 25th instant, for Lyon.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. L. SHOUP,

First Lieutenant, First Cavalry of Colorado.
