CHARLESTON, S. C., July 12, 1864.

Special Orders, Numbers 89, from your office, orders Fifty-fifth Georgia Regiment from Johnson's army to Savannah. I presume the Sixty-fifth was meant, as the Fifty-fifth is not with Johnston. Can you not correct the error and order the Sixty-fifth to me? In consequence of enemy's attack I have 300 of the Fourth Georgia Cavalry here dismounted; their horses sent to Atlanta. Enemy has made no attack here since my last. I think they will try at some other point of my lines.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.
