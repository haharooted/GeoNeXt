HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,
Saint Louis, Mo., June 1, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN, Warrensburg, Mo.:

In reply to your telegram relative to the issuing of an order making all property captured by the citizen guards prizes to the captors, the major-general directs me to say that he has no authority to issue such an order, and cannot, therefore, sanction anything of the kind. Yet, if the citizen guards really capture from the enemy any property, the general thinks under the circumstances no very strict accountability would be called for, unless in matters of grave and vital importance.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
