BROWNSVILLE, ARK., May 31, 1864

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just been informed that 300 rebels are in the vicinity of Ashley's Mills. I will send a force down to Richwoods to intercept them. Can you send a force from Little Rock down the river to Bear Skin Lake? Caution them about my men being below them, that no accident may happen by firing at each other.

O. WOOD,

Colonel, Commanding.

(Copy furnished for information of General Salomon, who will send scout to Bear Skin Lake, which is 12 miles east of Little Rock, on north side of the Arkansas.)
