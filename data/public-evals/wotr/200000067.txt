HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,
May 9, 1864-11.50 p. m.

Brigadier-General McCook, Commanding Cavalry Division:

I inclose a dispatch* for General Stoneman, who is at Charleston to-night and is expected at Varnell's Station to-morrow afternoon. Please send and officer to meet him in the morning and give him information of our present position and the state of affairs generally, and arrange a concert of action with him on his arrival, if I am not able to send him orders after to-morrow's battle. General Sherman expects an attack from Johnston to-morrow, probably on my left flank. I desire you to make a demonstration on the Dalton road at dawn of day in the morning and gain the earliest possible information of any movement of the enemy on my left flank, both at that time and during the day. This is of vital importance.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
