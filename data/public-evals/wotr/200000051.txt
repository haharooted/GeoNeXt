HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,
Camp at Snake Creek Gap, May 9, 1864-5.30 a. m.

(Received 9 a. m.)

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I am pushing on through Snake Creek Gap and will undoubtedly meet the enemy. I have left two brigades of infantry to guard my trains at the west entrance and shall move through in light fighting order. There is a road leading over the mountain from Dalton about six miles to the north of Snake Creek Gap. This road, I understood from General Kilpatrick, is controlled by your troops. If it is not guarded it leaves my trains and flank exposed.

Truly, yours,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
