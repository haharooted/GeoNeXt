HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,
Point of Rocky Face, May 10, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General McCOOK,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: General Sherman is desirous of knowing whether the line of railroad is in repair from Red Clay to Dalton. The repairs at Red Clay have been completed, but it is important to know whether there are any breaks between that point and as far as our cavalry can go toward Dalton. If you are not already sufficiently apprised to give me the desired information send a force the first thing in the morning to ascertain, and communicate the facts to me as soon as practicable. It is of great importance.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
