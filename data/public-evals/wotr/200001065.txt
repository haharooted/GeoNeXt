CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864-10. 10 a. m.

Captain DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Report just received from cavalry says rebels are making for mouth of Paint Lick, and are now crossing river. Some of them will, no doubt, be stopped on this side. With forge sent from Lexington and from this camp, I think of the rascals will be caught.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
