HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH, Folly Island, S. C., July 25, 1864.

Colonel A. S. HARTWELL,
Commanding Post, Folly Island:

COLONEL: In to-day's outpost report from Kiawah Island, the following occurs: "Rebel pickets were observed through the night, opposite rifle-pit B."

The general commanding directs that you send a reliable officer to investigate this matter, using the picket on Kiawah Island for the purpose. He will endeavor to find whether there are any traces of the enemy near our front, without going too far form the picket-line.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. K. SMITH,

Captain Island, S. C., July 25, 1864.
