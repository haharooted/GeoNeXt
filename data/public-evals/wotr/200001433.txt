JUNCTION RANCH, COLO. TER., April 12, 1864.

[Colonel J. M. CHIVINGTON:]

Send me more troops; all you can spare. If this is not stopped we will have the Sioux to fight as well as Cheyennes. The small command I have cannot perform the amount of duty required; besides, the horses will all be used up. Two howitzers will do to scare, while the cavalry fight. Can you send them to me? After a pursuit of all day yesterday captured and destroyed eleven lodges, all their implements for cooking and dressing hides, &c., besides taking a number of buffalo robes. Caught no Indiana. Will write particulars.

J. DOWNING,

Major First Colorado Cavalry.
