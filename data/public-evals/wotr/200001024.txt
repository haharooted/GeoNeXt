FLAG-STEAMER PHILADELPHIA, Port Royal Harbor, S. C., July 18, 1864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Commanding Dept. of the South, Hdqrs. Hilton Head:

GENERAL: It will soon be necessary to discharge from the Navy a considerable number of contrabands at this place, because of the expiration of their terms of service. The most of them have not served more than a year, and many of them have families in the vicinity. Inasmuch as every able-bodied man should be made to contribute his due share of service in bearing arms, I should like to know whether you have taken any measures in this respect regarding the land service. I think these people make some calculation to escape the full extent of military service, by a partial term afloat, and where they are more or less useful, and where they may be willing to remain if they find they have to serve somewhere for a full term.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. DAHLGREN,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
