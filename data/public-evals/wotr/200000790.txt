CAPE GIRARDEAU, June 3, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding:

The enemy are unusually active just now. Colonel McLane sends me word that 200 camped near Patton, at a mill, last night. I have sent 200 men in two directions after them. Ewing, at Charleston, reports one company. I have sent 25 men to him, and have ordered him to go after them. Hiller reports a force at Cane Island, and a gentleman late from Doniphan says they are there and picket all the roads. Number not known. Besides these parties, small squads are everywhere in the swamps. Hiller is after them. My whole force is on the move and we will clear them out, or try. But I think that they are covering some more important move by this cloud of guerrillas. Those at the mill were grinding corn all night. I think McRae means mischief at Patterson. What do you think of bringing Dallas to Jackson, within supporting distance?

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
