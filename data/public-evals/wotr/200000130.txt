FORT MONROE, VA., March 4, 1864. (Received 2. 30 a. m., 5th. _

I forward the annexed account from General Kilpatrick:

YORKTOWN, March 4, 1864.

GENERAL: Colonel Dahlgren was directed to make a diversion with 500 men on the James River. He attacked at 4 p. m. Tuesday evening; drove the enemy in on Richmond. The main attack having failed, Colonel Dahlgren attempted to rejoin me near the Meadow Bridge. He and Colonel [Major] Cooke were with the advance guard, some 50 men; became separated from his main force, since with nothing has been heard from him. He is main force reached me with slight loss. I have hopes that he may yet come in.

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Expedition.

In addition, a rebel deserter informed one of my aides that a one legged colonel and about 100 men were taken prisoners. I shall hear by flag of truce on Sunday night. Will telegraph again.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
