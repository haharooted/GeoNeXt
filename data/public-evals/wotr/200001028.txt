HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,
Hilton Head, S. C., May 25, 1864.

Rear-Admiral J. A. DAHLGREN,

Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

ADMIRAL: It was, until lately, the practice of the officer commanding the vessels blockading Saint Helena to send a boat or boats, at night, up into Coosaw Sound, opposite the horses of Coosaw and Morgan's Islands. I am informed that this has been lately discontinued. I would respectfully request that instructions be given the officer at present commanding on that station to resume such patrol, and to extend to tour as far as the saw-mill on Coosaw Island. A descent was made night before last upon Morgan's Island, and 12 persons carried off. Parties have also been seen reconnoitering the saw-mill, the destruction of which would be a serious inconvenience to us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Department.
