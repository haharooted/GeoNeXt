MEMPHIS, June 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

On the 10th instant General Sturgis was defeated near Guntown, Miss. He was badly cut up and his loss will reach 3,000 or 4,000 men. It is a very bad affair, but I have few details as yet. At last accounts the enemy was moving this way, his advance cavalry at Collierville, and a large infantry force was at Ripley last night moving this way. General A. J. Smith is here with about 6,000 men and very little artillery. General Canby writes me that the indications are that Kirby Smith is concentrating his force to operate against General Steele, and asks me to keep troops in hand to aid General Steele. Under existing circumstances shall General Smith make the contemplated demonstration on Mobile?

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
