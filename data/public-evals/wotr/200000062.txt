TUNNEL HILL, May 10, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Rocky Face:

GENERAL: Keep your entire command ready to move to this place. McPherson did not break the railroad although he reached Resaca, which he found fortified and manned. I may make one of two moves, and either or both very sudden; take up my whole army and move to Resaca, or leave you here with Stoneman's cavalry at the point now occupied by you to cover this narrow outlet, and with Thomas to issue on the east of Rocky Face at Sugar Valley and interpose between Johnston and his base. The latter I prefer. If possible, hurry Stoneman, and write me your opinion.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
