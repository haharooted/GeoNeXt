COLLIERVILLE, June 12, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

I did intend remaining here until to-morrow principally to enable stragglers to get in, but from information just received of a force moving in the direction of White's Station, I deem it prudent to mach for that place to-night, and will do so.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General.
