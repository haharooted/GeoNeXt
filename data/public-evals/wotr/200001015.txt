[Second indorsement.]

HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, City Point, Va. August 16, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

As I have requested that all the troops can be spared from General Foster's command be brought forward, and that General Foster for the present act purely on the defensive at Charleston, there is no necessity for sending these vessels.

U. S. GRANT,
Lieutenant-General.
