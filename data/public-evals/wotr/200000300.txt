HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,
New Orleans, January 27, 1864.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, Department of the Gulf:

SIR: I herewith inclose report received last p. m. from General Dana. It will be seen by it that the commander of the forces at Matagorda Bay is not responsible for delays of transports at that place, and it will be further seen that the facilities for making any move of troops from Matagorda Bay, or about it, are inadequate to insure rapidity or safety.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General, Volunteers.
