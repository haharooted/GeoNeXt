[Fifth indorsement.]

QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE, Charleston, January 27, 1864.

Respectfully returned, through chief quartermaster, with the remark that on the 8th of December four oil landers were ordered from Messrs Adams and Damon, and taken down to Fort Sumter by Lieutenant Swinton, the receipt of which Lieutenant-Colonel Elliott acknowledges, and these lanterns I am informed are now at the fort. I have no record of any other requisitions for landers being made. I have, however, shipped this evening four additional quartermaster of Fifth Military District, upon whom all requisitions from Fort Sumter, I respectfully submit, should be made.

MOTTE A. PRINGLE,

Major and Quartermaster.
