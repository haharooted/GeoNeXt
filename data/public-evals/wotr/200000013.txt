MEMPHIS, TEN., June 26, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

GENERAL: I send my aide, Captain W. C. Rawolle, to visit you in person, in order that you may receive a true version of the circumstances which led to the failure of my expediting. I regret that I have not yet been able to complete my official report and furnish you with a copy. I am exceedingly anxious that you receive the newspaper slanders for what they are worth, and make up your mind as to my part o this unfortunate affair only after hearing the truth. On returning to Memphis I asked General Washburn to relieve me from active duty for the present. He did so, and directed me to report by telegraph to the Secretary of War. This I did, but have received no reply. I also made application for a court to investigate the causes of our defeat. A court or commission has been ordered, but not at my request, and nearly all the commanders of DIVISIONS and brigades (whom I asked might be summoned) have again taken the field. The commission, I learn, will meet to- morrow, and I am retained as a witness. In short, there is no doubt but this is a simple inquisition, and I do hope you will dissolve it and order a commission of intelligent officers who will give me a hearing. I inclose copies of communications received from Colonel McMillen, who commanded the infantry, and Colonel Waring, + who commanded a brigade of cavalry. I have others and will receive still others from nearly all commanders, as they have called upon me to tender their testimony in regard to my conduct of the campaign. If your order a court I hope it will be at some other point than this, say Cincinnati or Louisville, or anywhere except here.

I am, general, very respectfully,

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier- General.
