Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS,
Chaffin's Farm, February 7, 1864-12. 10.

I have just received a dispatch from Major Robertson, who learned from a Mr. Christian that the enemy at Bottom's Bridge are 10,000 strong, and others advancing on another road (the numbers and road not stated). He also inclosed a dispatch from Lieutenant Havenner that the enemy is advancing on the Telegraph and Diascond roads (numbers not stated). The Southside Artillery has arrived; and is in position on the Varina road at fortifications, for the present; six splendid Napoleons. I have directed Major Robertson, in case a retirement before the enemy should be unavoidable, to retire on my infantry pickets at New Market. Colonel Shingler will retire toward Richmond. I hope a back step will not be necessary.

Respectfully, &c.,

EPPA HUNTON,

Brigadier-General.
