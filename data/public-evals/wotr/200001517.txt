FORT SUMTER, January 14, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that affairs continue quiet. The density of the fog affords good cause for an assault, but it would not find us unprepared.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
