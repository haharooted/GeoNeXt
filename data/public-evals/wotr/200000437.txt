HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO, Denver, Colo. Ter., April 16, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,
Fort Union, N. Max.:

SIR: I have the honor to request that you will send out a detachment from your command to meet and escort to your post the train of commissary stores now en route from Denver, Colo. Ter. The long anticipated difficulties with the Indians in this Territory appear to have reached a crisis. A fight has already occurred between a small detachment of my troops and the Cheyennes, with some loss on both sides. All my troops are now required for service, and I have ordered Lieutenant Shoup, who, with a detachment of 35 men, has been escorting said train, to return with his command to Camp Fillmore, Colo. Ter.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. CHIVINGTON,

Colonel First Cavalry of Colorado, Commanding District.
