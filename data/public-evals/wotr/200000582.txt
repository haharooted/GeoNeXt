Colonel W. R. JUDSON,

Commanding District of the Frontier:

The general is glad to hear from you. Major Green telegraphed you last night orders about the transportation, and ordered the Ninth Kansas to report to you as soon as practicable. General Thayer probably made the connection with General Steele at 5 miles from Camden last Friday.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
