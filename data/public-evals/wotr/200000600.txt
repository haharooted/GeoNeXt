WARRENSBURG, MO., May 29, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I respectfully ask, if the rebels move from Arkansas in force, will I receive support from the east, or shall I look to General Curtis, and make my dispositions with that expectation? His reply to my telegram, copy of which I sent to you, was that if absolutely necessary General McKean would send me a regiment. This is very vague.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
