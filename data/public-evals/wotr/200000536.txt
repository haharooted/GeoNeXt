NASHVILLE, TENN., April 15, 1864.

General STEELE,

Via Little Rock:

Dispatch of 7th from Camden is received. I know that General Grant expects Generals Banks and A. J. Smith's forces to come out of Red River for some other work very soon, and you should push with all possible speed to make a junction on Red River. Banks' forces should by this time be in Shreveport.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
