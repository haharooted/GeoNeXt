HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT HILTON HEAD, &C.,
Hilton Head, June 11, 1864.

Captain W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: An examination made by myself of the deserters from Savannah elected the following important fact: The rebels are engaged in taking out the guns of the Water Witch for the purpose of lightening here sufficiently to enable her to pass through Thunderbolt Creek into the Savannah River. I would again call the attention of the major-general commanding to the danger of an attack from the combined naval force of the enemy upon the southern end of Hilton Head Island, unless an ample naval force is kept in Calibogue Sound.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.- There is in Savannah a steam-ship built since the war, completely fitted for sea, called Numbers 10., supposed to be intended for a blockade-runner.
