HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
New Orleans, January 26, 1864.

Major General WILLIAM B. FRANKLIN,

Commanding Nineteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires that you immediately visit personally the troops of your corps in the field, and make such arrangements as shall, in your opinion, render them safe against any concentration of the enemy, which may be attempted. If re-enforcement are necessary he desires that you should report to him to number of troops or what kind of naval assistance may be required. He also desires that if in your opinion, after personal examination, you should deem it advisable to take up a different position during the temporary period of rest preceding impending movements, that you should report the fact and recommend such position.

While it is desirable that the troops should not be unnecessarily harassed by marches, the safety of the force, until the direction of future movements shall be decided, is of the first importance. The commanding general requests that you visit to the troops in the field should be immediate.

Very respectfully, I am, general, your most obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
