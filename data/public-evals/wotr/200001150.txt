ROUND VALLEY, CAL., August 23, 1862.

Honorable G. M. HANSON:

DEAR SIR: I should not again have addressed you so soon, had it not been for the fact, or receipt of a visit from Colonel Lippitt. It was agreed upon by the party following Colonel Lippitt, Colonel Henley, and myself, that information should be given you, that you might come in company with Sargent, and meet here, and, if possible, devise some means to purchase the surplus produce in this valley, which is thought sufficient until the season comes round, and which can be done in case Sargent will agree to use his best endeavors to obtain an appropriation taking the whole valley, or, in other words, buying them all out. Do not delay this visit.

Truly, yours,

JAMES SHORT,

Supervisor Round Valley Reservation.
