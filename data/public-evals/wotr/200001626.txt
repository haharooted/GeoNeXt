HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT

Fort Humboldt, May 29, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that Captain Hull, with twenty men of Company D, Second Infantry California Volunteers, proceeded on the 3rd instant from Fort Bragg in pursuit of a band of hostile Indians who had been committing depredations on the coast; that on the 9th instant, with a detachment of eight men, he came up with them near Shelter Cove, and out of some thirty-five or forty killed 4 and wounded 3, too severely to be carried away, bringing in 1 boy and 5 squaws as prisoners, who were delivered over to the supervisor on the Mendocino Reservation. In consequence of the representatinos of some of the inhabitants of the outskirts of Arcata, instead of bringing Company I to this post I have halted it at Camp Curtis, near that place, where it is now stationed. To embark that company and the one at Fort Humboldt, twenty-four hours' notice would suffice, but to embark the companies at Fort Gaston and Fort Baker (Captain Morton's and Captain Flynn's) four days' notice at least would be required. The supply of the companies of montaineers will employ all, or nearly all, the pack-mules at this post. The distance to Captain Douglas' command in Round Valley is 150 miles. If it is to be supplied from this post nearly the whole, perhaps quite the whole, of the transportation will have to be hired. If it is intended that I shall forward supplies thither, I request an instruction to that effect by the next steamer.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully your obedient servant,

FRANCIS J. LIPPITT

Colonel Second Infantry California Vols., Commanding Humboldt Mil. Dist.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Pacific.
