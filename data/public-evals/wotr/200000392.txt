HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,
Jefferson City, January 22, 1864

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis;

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that a body of about 50 men have made their appearance on the line of Jackson County, about 7 miles northwest of Chapel Hill, who are reported to belong to Blunt's and Todd's guerrilla bands. On the 16th they were pursued by a company of First Missouri State Militia and dispersed. Search was made for them on the 17th and 18th, but no trace could be found. I have reason to believe that these parties are from the Kansas border, and have personated Blunt's and Todd's bands.

I am, truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
