Brownsville, Tex., January 25, 1864

Brigadier General CHARLES P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have received several letters from M. M. Kimmey, vice-consul at Montgomery, in regard to moneys expended by him by order of Generals Banks and Dana for expresses, &c. In response I have notified him that when expresses are hired he will make out regular triplicate vouchers, getting the receipt of the person, and forward same to me for payment. I have furnished him some blank vouchers, and this can be done regularly through the quartermaster's department.

The expresses referred to were sent from Monterey to General Carleton, at El Pase, and several sent from Monterey to General Dana, at this place, with important information. Mr. Kimmey has in addition expended considerable money aiding refugees, and has furnished money to send forward persons to enlist in the cavalry regiments. There is no salary attached to his office, and I am told by persons from Monterey that he is badly in need of the funds expended in this way. Will the general commanding please advise me whether to furnish him money or not.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General.
