ROUND VALLEY, October 19, 1862.

Honorable G. M. HANSON:

DEAR SIR: I again call your attention to the aggrievances which I have given you an account of in a former communication, perpetrated by a portion of our while population. In additino to what I have written you, I will briefly state that our supervisor planted 100 acres of corn, 50 or 60 acres of wheat, which has been entirely destroyed by our neighbors' cattle and hogs, and destroyed a part of other grain which has been raised on this reservation; fences have been let down at night and their stock driven in. Now, sir, what language can I make use of to awaken you so that some action may be taken to prevent these outrages? Winter is near at hand and nothing to feed our Indians. There are many other strong reasons I might add why some immediate action should be taken, but forbear with a single remark, that unless some steps are taken in earnest immediately we shall be obliged to leave the reservation.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

W. P. MELENDY.
