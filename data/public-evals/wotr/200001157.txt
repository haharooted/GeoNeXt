HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,
Mesilla, September 10, 1862.

Captain THOMAS L. ROBERTS,

First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding, Franklin, Tex.:

I have just received your communication relative to the Indian outrages committed in the vicinity of San Elizario. I regret that it is out of my power to afford the aid solicited, and you will be good enough to say to the justice of the peace of that town that we came here prepared instantly to rid the country of the rebels, and to afford Union citizens protection against them, but not quite so readily prepared to suppress the outrages of the Apaches. The latter will, however, be undertaken in due time, and it is my hope to be enabled to inflict summary chastisement upon them. In the meantime I do not think it advisable to send cavalry in pursuit of the particular party of Indians refered to, nor have I the ability to furnish the inhabitants the arms and ammunition asked for. I shall write at once to the general commanding the department to have both arms and ammunition sent to me especially for the protection of the people against the Indians. I do not believe in the efficiency of these predatory expeditions of citizens against the Indians after the latter have committed their depredations. They swoop down upon localities where they well know that due caution is not observed, and before the citizens can be rallied to pursue them they are beyound threir reach. The people must be more cautious, and in a short time troops will be sent to their relief.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
