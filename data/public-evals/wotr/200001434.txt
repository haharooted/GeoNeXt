NASHVILLE, April 9, 1864.

General CURTIS:

General Grant telegraphs me that General Steele will hold Red River. General Banks is ordered, elsewhere, and the troops of A. J. Smith are merely loaned to Banks by me for thirty days, and these are about out. Steele will need re-enforcements, and they should come from Missouri and Kansas. If Steele can hold securely Shreveport and Alexandria you would need nothing but militia in Kansas. Your re-enforcements should go by land to Fort Smith and on to Red River, wherever General Steele may be. General Grant me to direct in that matter, and I ask what troops you can send. Of course we must concentrate here and Virginia all the men possible, leaving you west of the Mississippi to hold in check Price and Kirby Smith.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
