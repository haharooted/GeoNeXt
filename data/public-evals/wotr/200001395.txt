HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,
Washington, January 28, 1864.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

New Orleans:

GENERAL: Three batteries of artillery and a regiment of cavalry have been embarked from Baltimore for your command. A regiment of New York veteran cavalry is now being embarked at this place. It is sent with equipments but without horses, as transportation for horse by sea cannot now be procured. The Quartermaster-General expects to send you horses by the Mississippi River. A regiment of infantry will be ready here as soon as vessels can be obtained. The two regiments in Maine, reported ready for the field and ordered to you, are now reported not quite ready.

Several regiments of Indiana troops are expected to be ready in a short time. They will be sent by the Mississippi River. Some of the New York regiments are also reported as nearly ready. There may, however, be some delay in getting them off for want of ocean vessels. The difficulty results in part from the detention of seagoing vessels in the Department of the Gulf. To obviate it, such vessels should be returned North as early as possible. Unless this is done, there must be deadly in sending you troops from the North and East.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
