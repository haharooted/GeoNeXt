HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, Cal., September 27, 1862.

Captain HENRY B. MELLEN,

Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding Fort Crook:

(Through Hinchman & Barlett, Red Bluffs, Cal.)

SIR: The department commander has received information which leads to the belief that the party of Indians against which you were directed to operate are marauding on the Chico road in the direction of Mountain Meadows. As the emigration into the northern part of this State is now passing over that route, the general desires you to afford it all the protection in your power, in addition to the other duties assigned you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
