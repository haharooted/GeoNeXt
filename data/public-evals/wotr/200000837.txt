CHARLESTON, S. C., June 6, 1864.

Bonaud's battalion has been detained at Savannah a few days because of the threatening aspect of affairs there. Night before last orders were telegraphed to General McLaws to send it on without delay, but yesterday General McLaws telegraphed that several gun-boats and an iron-clad had approached Beaulieu, and transports were seen going south from here (one, at least, with troops on board), and this morning the Ironsides and two other steamers have crossed the bar, apparently going south, probably to Savannah to look after the Water Witch, or make some attack. Can I retain Bonaud's battalion longer?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
