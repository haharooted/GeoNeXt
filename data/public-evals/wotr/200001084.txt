Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Spencer House, Cincinnati, Ohio:

General Carrington telegraphs from Louisville at 1 p. m.: Messenger arrived from Frankfort; all bridges burned this side of Kentucky River; rebels left Lexington for Paris. Carrington is of the opinion they will cross westward, cutting Sherman's line. Great indifference of people at Louisville; not one company organized. Indiana militia assembling at Jeffersonville, but hesitate about leaving the State. He hopes to hear from you.
