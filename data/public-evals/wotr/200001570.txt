[JUNE 14, 1864. - For congratulatory dispatches to Burbridge, from President Lincoln, Secretary Stanton, and General Schofield, see Part I, p. 27.]

NASHVILLE, TENN., June 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Near Atlanta:

The following dispatch contains all the information I have; was received last night from General Carrington at Louisville:

Communications with Frankfort opened. Governor Bramlette says a part of Morgan's command crossed the Lexington and Frankfort Railroad, moving south. Morgan was whipped by Burbridge, losing nearly half his force. He cannot have with him over 2,000 men. He may attempt to force your line at some point. On Friday he had scouts at Lebanon, looking to contingencies of escape in that direction.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
