January 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Commanding District of Southwest Missouri:

GENERAL: I would respectfully report that Lieutenant Finley, Company F, Sixth Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, has just returned with his command of 30 men from a scout of seven days. He left camp on the 12th instant. He reports that he proceeded first to Montevallo, in Vernon County, from thence scouted through the counties of Cedar and Benton. I did not see or hear of any guerrillas in that section, nor see anything that would indicate that there had been any there in the last month. He reports that there are but few inhabitants in that section of the country; the most of the houses in that part have either been burned or vacated. He returned with his command on the evening of the 18th, without any casualties whatever. Distance traveled about 300 miles. Reports forage tolerably plenty.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. MURPHY,

Captain, Commanding Sixth Missouri State Militia Cavalry.
