WARRENSBURG, MO., May 30, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE, Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major Gregory had sent out a scout of 50 men for a five days' pilgrimage among the bushwhackers before the order directing him to join his regiment reached him. I will call the men in at the earliest favorable moment and send him to Saint Louis. All quiet on Platte.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
