FLAG-STEAMER PHILADELPHIA, Off Charleston, S. C., July 22, 1864.

Rear-Admiral J. A. DAHLGREN,

Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

SIR: In conformity with your instructions, I went on board of the Nahant yesterday evening about 6 to see that everything was ready for the explosion of the powder, and also your order to Captain Mayo "to use his own direction," and that you relied entirely upon his judgment in the execution of the matter. Captain Mayo decided not to go on account of the very bad state of the weather, but he desired to complete the undertaking as soon as the weather would permit. I also delivered your order for Captain Mayo to come down as soon as the explosion was over, in case he should have gone up, and let the regular picket monitor take her station for the night. On my return to the flag-ship, I gave a passage to Captain Shelton and Acting Ensign Neil to the Cosmopolitan in my boat. From the fact of Captain Mayo deciding not to go, after delivering your order to act at discretion, these officers may have ben led to believe that I brought an order not to make the experiment last night.

Respectfully,

E. J. DICHMAN,

Ensign, U. S. Navy.
