HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., July 1, 1864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Commanding Department of the South, Hilton Head:

GENERAL: I send with this a letter addressed by 5 general officers of the U. S. Army, now prisoners of war in this city, to Brigadier General L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. S. Army, recommending and asking an exchange of prisoners of war. I fully concur in opinion with the officers who have signed the letter that there should be an exchange of prisoners of war, and, although I am not instructed by my Government to enter into negotiations for that purpose, I have no doubt that it is willing and desirous now, as it has ever been, to exchange prisoners of war with your Government on just and honorable plans. Our difficulty in the way of carrying out the cartel of exchange agreed on between the two Governments would not exist, that I am aware of, if the exchange was conducted between you and myself. If, therefore, you think proper to communicate on the subject with your Government I will, without delay, communicate with mine, and it may be that we can enter into an agreement, subject to the approval of our respective Governments, by which the prisoners of war now languishing in confinement may be released. I should be glad to aid in so humane a work, and to the end that there may be no unnecessary delay on my part I have directed an officer of my staff, Major John F. Lay, assistant adjutant and inspector general, charged with the delivery of this, to wait a reasonable time in the vicinity of Port Royal Ferry for you answer. He is fully informed of my views on this subject, and, if you desire it, will confer with you or any officer you may designate.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General, Commanding.
