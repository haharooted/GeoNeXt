CHARLESTON, February 8, 1864-9 p. m.

Enemy's demonstration at Jacksonville, Fla., indicates intention to cut off our supplies from that quarter. Five thousand State troops in South Carolina and Georgia have just been discharged. Cannot their place be supplied from another source to enable me to send sufficient force to Florida without endangering Charleston and Savannah?
