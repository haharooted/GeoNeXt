MILWAUKEE, WIS., April 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General SIBLEY,

Saint Poul, Minn.:

Please assign horses as they arrive from La Crosse, first to the troops you are to send to Sully. There may be short delay in the arrival of the last of the lost of horses for your district, but Sully's force must be mounted first and sent to him as soon as the season will permit. Acknowledge receipt of this telegram.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.
