Pleasant Hill, April 9, 1864.

Major General W. B. FRANKLIN:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires that your command shall be silently withdrawn during the night from its present position, and drawn back on the Grand Ecore road to a point which shall give the advantages of a strong position and a supply of water, both of which are wanting for a force of the size of his command. The commanding general will be happy to confer with you on this subject to-night.

Very respectfully, &c.,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
