HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,
Fort Yuma, September 21, 1862.

Major R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:

MAJOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of instructions of the 11th ultimo [instant], in which you say that the department commander desires me, as soon as possible after the receipt of it, to move with three companies of my regiment and the headquarters to New San Pedro. As I should not be able to carry out the orders fully, but only in part, I have thought it best that I should give you a statement of the difficulty in the way and await further instructions. In the first place there are no troops at Fort Barrett, the companies that were stationed there having been ordered from that post to Tucson some time since; nor are there any between this post and Tucson, except the few men at the express stations, so that, five companies of my regiment being at Tucson and beyond with General Carleton and four here, I cannot leave two companies here if three are to go with me. Then, again, as Lieutenant-Colonel Dobbins is under arrest, in consequence of an unfortunate affair between him and some other officers of the regiment, and charges of a grave character have been preferred against him, which you will receive by the mail with this, there is no field officer to take command of the post, as I respectfully submit there should be, considering its importance and the vast amount of Government stores almost constantly arriving here. As these facts were not known to you and are matters of moment, I hope the course which I have pursued under the circumstances will meet the approval of the general commanding the department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. W. BOWIE,

Colonel Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
