FORT SUMTER, January 30, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report the Ironsides, 4 monitors, 2 gun-boats, 2 tugs, 14 sailing vessels inside; the Wabash and 6 blockaders outside; 5 steamers and 10 schooners in Light-House Inlet. Fire direct on the west angle from one 200-pounder at Gregg and one 100-pounder at the middle battery, probably the gun formerly used against the city. A garrison gin is now stationed in the adjoining embrasure. Number of shots fired since morning, 159; hit, 138; missed, 21. West angle much cut.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
