CHARLESTON, S. C., July 10, 1864-7 p. m.

Yesterday morning Brigadier-General Robertson attached enemy on John's Island, near the Stono, and drove them from first position, with loss to us of over 100 killed and wounded. Last night and this morning enemy fell back to their transports near Legareville and passed over the James and Morris Islands. Two monitors and several gun-boats still in Stono, but have been driven by our batteries beyond effective range. One monitor believed seriously damaged by sot from one of our Brooke guns. Movements this evening indicate purpose to change point of attack. From prisoners [and] manuscript captured it appears that the force now operating against this place comprises all the available force on South Atlantic coast. Bombardment of Fort Sumter has been very heavy for several days and continues so.

Major-General.
