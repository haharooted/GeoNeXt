HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA,
Omaha, Nebr. Ter., January 19, 1864

Captain JOHN WILCOX,

Co. B, Seventh Iowa Cav., Commanding Post, Dakota, Nebr. Ter.:

CAPTAIN: Your favor of the 16th instant is received. The general commanding the district directs me to say that under existing circumstances it is not deemed safe to send the captured property out of the District of Nebraska by soldiers for the purpose of turning it over to Major J. B. Hoffman, U. S. Indian agent for the Ponca Indians. The general suggests that some one should receive it as Major Hoffman's agent at Niobrara, or some other convenient place within this district, as it would be dangerous to take it on the Ponca Reservation for the purpose of delivery. If Major Hoffman refuses to receive the property you will turn it over to the acting assistant quartermaster, to be accounted for by him and disposed of as may hereafter be directed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
