CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

My pickets have just brought in some prisoners - one, Major A. Lawson McAfee, of Nicholasville. There are 1,500 men in detachment. Will send out 100 men to pick up stragglers. Same force you mentioned last night, about, I suppose, 300 men. Have you no cavalry to send out to intercept them? My force is not strong enough for that.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
