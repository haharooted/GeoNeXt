WM. G. THOMPSON,

Major, &c.

Matagorda Peninsula, Tex., January 28, 1864.

Brigadier General W. P. BENTON,

Commanding Post at Indianola:

You are instructed, should any Texans who have come within the lines form the enemy make any attempt to get by the picket-lines and escape again to the enemy, to give such orders to the guards that they shall be shot on the spot and not captured. You are also directed to put a stop to small boats leaving your post for the purpose of getting fish and oysters or any other pretense, except when they have on board at least 4 good reliable soldiers, well armed, so as to prevent any treachery.

Respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
