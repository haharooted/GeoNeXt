GENERAL'S BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 2, 1864 - 2.30 a. m. (Received 10.30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

I forward for the information of the War Department an extract of a letter, dated Charleston, May 6, 1864, taken from the dead body of Colonel O. M. Dantzler, Twenty-second South Carolina Regiment, who was killed in an attack upon our lines this morning, and whose dead body is in our hands:

No news; all very quiet here. We are very short-handed now. The Twentieth [South Carolina] was positively ordered, and was ready to go, but the order was countermanded and it is now the only infantry left nearer Charleston than Savannah. If we are allowed to remain quiet, all this is well enough, but if we should be attacked by any of the approaches to the city, I fear the consequences. The contingency is too gloomy to think about.

B. F. BUTLER.
