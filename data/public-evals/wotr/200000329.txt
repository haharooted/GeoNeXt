HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE EASTERN ARKANSAS,
Helena, Ark., January 29, 1864.

Rear-Admiral PORTER:

DEAR SIR: Geneal Sherman's expedition is passing down the river, and has taken all my white troops except 244 infantry and 296 cavalry. I have also 1,200 colored troops with which to man six field-works and to do duty on chain guard, 4 miles long. I have a large warehouse and one wharf-boat of ordnance of immense value, and four large warehouses and two wharf-boats filled with quartermaster's and commissary stores. This post is the base of supplies for General Steele's army. The rebel General McRae has parts of twenty companies of cavalry between here and White River. He could collect up 500 at any time, and make a dash on my extended lines. I have requested more white troops, but as it is very doubtful if I shall get them, I earnestly request you to order a guns-at here to co-operate with me.

The gun-boat in this vicinity are seldom here, as they have to watch the cotton speculators above and below. I make this request, as I deem it indispensably necessary.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
