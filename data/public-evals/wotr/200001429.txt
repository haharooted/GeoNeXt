SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 17, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Culpeper:

The Ninth Iowa will be sent as ordered. The Twelfth Missouri and Thirteenth Illinois Cavalry can follow, but they are not mounted, nor have we any other mounted troops within 120 miles of Saint Louis. Judging from the last news of the rebels going south from Frot Pillow, and the tenor of you dispatch, I shall await your orders before sending forward foot troops.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
