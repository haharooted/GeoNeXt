LEXINGTON, KY., June 14, 1864.

Colonel J. W. WEATHERFORD,

Stanford, Ky.:

The general commanding directs that you make such disposition of your command as you may deem best to insure assistance to Colonel Eve, at Camp Burnside, should be threatened, and to pick up as many of Morgan's men as possible. Act on your discretion and report operations here. The rebels are only anxious to get to a place of safety.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
