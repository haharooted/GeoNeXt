Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS,
Chaffin's Farm, February 7, 1864.

MAJOR: One of my men (of the Thirty-second Regiment), serving under Lieutenant Hume, has just arrived to give the particulars of the late advance of the enemy. He says he was in 15 yards of the column when it passed. It consisted of one brigade of cavalry, three brigades of infantry, and twelve pieces of artillery. He says that independent of this force there was a large force below, 3 miles below the Burnt Ordinary. He could form no accurate idea of this force, as they were below the scouts; judged it was large from the incessant beating of drums. The cavalry was some distance ahead of the infantry and artillery. He thinks the infantry did not come farther than Barhamsville last night; this is 27 miles from Bottom's Bridge. If he is right in this, the infantry and cavalry had not gotten to Bottom's Bridge before the cavalry fell back. He does not know who commanded the expedition. This scout reports that they killed 3 Yankee sergeants on the upward march. A dispatch just received from Colonel Shinlger says his cavalry pursued the enemy to Crump's Cross-Roads, which is about 5 miles.

Now, if this report of the forces of the enemy is correct (and I have no doubt of it), I am at a loss to understand why the enemy has retired for the small repulse received. Query: Have they abandoned the object of the expedition? I do not yet fell sure of it.

They brought very few wagons (not over fifteen or twenty in all) and a rapid raid only seems to have been contemplated. It would not surprise me if they had fallen back to make a better start, probably on some other road. I shall keep up the utmost diligence until I am satisfied. Please inform me if I shall recall the infantry and Major Stark's artillery, as soon as Colonel Shingler is satisfied the expedition is abandoned. Please answer this last inquiry to-night.

Respectfully, &c.,

EPPA HUNTON,

Brigadier-General.
