[Inclosure Numbers 1.] HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES IN THE FIELD, Camp Kagi, Chickasaw Nation, February 15, 1864.

General COLBERT,

Of the Chickasaw Nation:

GOVERNOR: When I passed your house I could not find you. Were you a fugitive from fear, or did you flee as a man who wants to be an enemy? Had you come to me frankly you would have found a friend. The Government has not believed that you really desired to fight it, but your conduct leaves the matter in great doubt and will expose your people. Why did you send for soldiers to keep the troops of the United States out of the Chickasaw Nation? Your treaties require you to admit their presence. Are we to understand that you now want formally to break these treaties? These questions must be answered, and answered soon. Your power as head man was not given you to gratify your prejudice or pride. You are responsible to your people, and have no right to expose them to ruin when the Government offers them mercy.

The President has issued a proclamation in which he offers pardon and peace to those who, even in this moment of its destruction, abandoned this wicked and unnecessary war. You cannot fail to see the end coming. Are you justified in shutting the eyes of your people to it? The offer Government of the United States will soon crush all the enemies. Let me know if you want to be among them.

I send you some letters by a prisoners to head men of some Indiana nations; deliver them; they have a right to know what the United States Government says. Their blood may be upon you if you neglect it. I shall hold you accountable for their safe delivery.

I remain, with respect, yours, &c.,

WM. A. PHILLIPS,

Colonel, Commanding U. S. Forces, Indian Territory.
