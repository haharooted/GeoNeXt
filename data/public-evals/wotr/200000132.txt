Major-General PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps.

Numbers 3. Reports of Brigadier General Francis T. Nicholls, C. S. Army.

LYNCHBURG, February 29, 18643.

I have just received from Captain Mallory, commanding at Charlottesville, the following dispatch:

Enemy's cavalry 3 miles from town. Can you send me any assistance? I want infantry.

The dispatch is dated February 29, and was received 5. 30 p. m. I have telegraphed to Charlottesville that I cannot. I will telegraph you again in a few moments. I have telegraphed to Captain Mallory to know more, and whether what he says is thoroughly reliable.

FRANCIS T. NICHOLS,

Brigadier-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
