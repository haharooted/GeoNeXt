Considering how her life was going in September, Kati Mather made an improbable appearance at a vigil to reflect on fentanyl deaths in Vancouver and push for more long-term treatment for addicts.
"If I didn't choose to get clean when I did, then I'd probably be dead today, and that's thanks to treatment," said Mather, 22, on Saturday from the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery.
In September, the CBC's Eric Rankin found her sitting in a pile of garbage bags along an infamous strip in Surrey, B.C.
She spoke candidly about her addiction and the risk that came with it.
"I overdosed 17 times," said Mather, who added that for the past seven years she has used oxycontin, heroin and then finally only fentanyl.
"Being close to death and going down to the place I was at has made me really want to change and as an addict, really the only way that you can get better is that you really have to want it."
Mather is now in a long-term treatment program at Westminster House, along with her twin sister, Jessi.
Alongside a small group of other recovering addicts, they lit candles on Saturday at an event put on by Recovery Day B.C., an organization that advocates for abstinence-based treatment programs.
