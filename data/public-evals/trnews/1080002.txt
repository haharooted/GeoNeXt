A couple from Melville, Sask. believes the furry stowaway found on a train that travelled from Winnipeg to Edmonton on Sunday is their pet.
Retired CN workers Brent and Lynnette Hain believe the cat -- dubbed "Q-199" after the train it was found on -- is actually their cat "Tiger."
"I lined up the pictures that I had and the ones you guys had, and I put them side by side and you can tell they're pretty well identical," Brent told CTV Edmonton.
The Hains had heard the story of "Q-199," who was found during a routine safety check in Wainwright, Alta., by train conductor Brad Slater.
The feline may have been hidden under the engine deck for up to 12 hours in temperatures that plunged as low as -40 degrees Celsius.
"It's just meant to be, it's a miracle," Slater told CTV Edmonton on Monday about the cat's survival.
The Hains live on a farm roughly one kilometre away from the train tracks, and they believe their runaway feline hopped on from there.
The couple got in touch with Slater after seeing the story on their local CTV News station and shared pictures of Tiger with him.
"The name 'Tiger' he responds to. So I honestly think itâ€™s their cat. As much as I don't want it to be, I think it is," Slater said.
Lynette Hains is planning to travel the same route her pet did on her way to Edmonton for the reunion.
Slater admits it will be hard parting with the cat he knows as "Q-199," but says he and his wife are planning on visiting the cat the Hains thought was a goner in Saskatchewan.
