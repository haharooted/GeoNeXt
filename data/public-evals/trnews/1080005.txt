A Regina teenager is facing an attempted murder charge after a woman was stabbed while she slept in her home, where police say the suspect lived as a renter.
Police were called to the home on the 200 block of Froom Crescent for a report of a break and enter in which a woman was injured.
When officers and paramedics arrived, they found a woman suffering from numerous stab wounds. The victim told police she was sleeping when she was awoken by a man, who stabbed her with a tool used in sheet metal work. The seriously injured woman was taken to hospital.
Investigators identified a male suspect, who police say was renting living space in the same home, and had fled the scene in his vehicle.
After searching for the suspect at several locations in Regina, police learned that RCMP in Manitoba had detained the suspect when his vehicle went off the road near the town of Virden.
Wesley Jettediah Brookes, 18, of Regina has been charged with attempted murder. He made his first appearance in Regina provincial court on Monday.
