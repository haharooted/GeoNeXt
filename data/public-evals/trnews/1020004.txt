Republican President-elect Donald Trump has described an impending recount of votes in Wisconsin
            as a "scam".
            Mr Trump, who narrowly won the state, said the results "should be respected instead of being challenged or
            abused".
            Green Party candidate Jill Stein had initiated the recount. She also wants recounts in Michigan and
            Pennsylvania, citing "statistical anomalies".
            Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign has said it would participate in Wisconsin's recount.
            Results would need to be overturned in all three states to alter the outcome of the 8 November presidential
            election.

            In a statement released by his transition team on Saturday, Mr Trump accused Dr Stein of trying to "fill her
            coffers with money" on the pretext of asking for donations towards a recount.
            "The people have spoken and the election is over," the statement said.
            Dr Stein defended her recount initiative, telling CNN that "the point to drive home here is that having a
            secure elections process benefits us all".
            She also suggested that she was open to looking at recounts in other states - not just Wisconsin, Michigan
            and Pennsylvania.
