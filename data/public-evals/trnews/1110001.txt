Organizers of a London rally in support of the people caught in the brutal conflict in Aleppo thanked Canada for what it has done but called for more action.
More than 200 people attended the rally in Victoria Park Saturday, chanting "free Syria" and "stop the killing."
Many cars passing by honked in support of the flag waving crowd that included a cross section of people from youngsters to seniors.
Jamal Taleb, Imam of the Islamic Centre in London, said Canada's stand against the indiscriminate killing of civilians is appreciated.
"We just want Canada to take more action," Taleb said. "The issue is to stop the killing."
Wael Haddara, a London doctor and spokesperson for the organizers, said the London event was designed to show solidarity with the people that are suffering in the Syrian city.
Haddara said there are credible reports of widespread atrocities against citizens, men and boys being lined up and shot and women raped.
"Even though we recognize this is happening half a world away we are saying we are part of humanity. If we don't stand in solidarity with a part of humanity that is suffering then we lose part of our own humanity," Haddara said.
