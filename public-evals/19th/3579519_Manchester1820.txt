RAIL-ROADS.  he circumstances under which the intended Birmingham and Liverpool Rail-road has been subscribed are very peculiar, and form a stronger prima facie case for an Act of incorporation, than any other contemplated Rail-road. First—The line of country passes through the heart of the staple mauufactures of the kingdom. Secondly—There has been, for half a century, ■ complete monopoly, and non-competition in the water transit of goods by canals. Notwithstsnding the quadruple increase of tonnage, no reduction, in any one instance, has been made in the charges to the public, except when collateTxl branches of different canals have been temporarily in competition. hirdly—Tne Compensations obtained from Parliament by the old canals against the new have become an intolerable burthen on freight. he above facts are singularly corroborated by comparison of the original and the present price or value of those canals, participating in the transit between Birmingham and Liverpool, as follow:— OLD BIRMINGHAM CANAL. Original Cost Present Value Annual Dividend per share. per share. per share. £140. £2,840. £ioo STAFFORD AND WORCESTER CANAL. 140 900 40 TRENT AND MEHSEY CANAL. 200 4,600 150 and bonus. COVENTRY CANAL. 160 1,340 44 and bonus. o this list are to be added the enormous annual revenues of the Stafford family from the Bridgewater canal! he commercial details of manufacturing prosperity and increase in Marwickshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Lancashire, and Cheshire, all taken from correct sources (chiefly Parliamentary Returns), as detailed in a pamphlet published by Mr. Joseph Parkes, incontestibly prove the necessity and importance of breaking up these vested interests. No wonder there are so many Companies stated with the temptation exhibited in the success of the old ones.
