"THE FIVE ALLS."  1 h« above is tho name of Messrs. Waroes Christmas Annual for the present year. he title is cf that fantastic character which has lately brocrr.ft so common with all publishers of "Ct-iimuaa aui-nalf " 7nwards thu latter end of tveiy year murtbi walls are pia\\>arded with startling announcements, and the public are mystified with inexplicable Ingenuity has been taxed this year to disoßto; what " The Five Alls, or " Mugby JunctioM means. here is, however, no longer any douß| about the signification of the first phrase. IS title itself Bimply relates to five well-toljp stories by a king, parson, soldier, farmer* and lawyer, respectively. But two-thirds ol the book are given over to the wildest fun and humour that could be desired,"even at the traditionally frolicsome time of Christmas. ragedy, comedy, burlesque, poetry, music, prose, and " pictures" are supplied in lavish profusion, until the reader is almost inclined to think that he has too much for his money. Not that any page is dull reading. he difficulty is on the other side, and the danger lies in the direction of excessive laughter, or of being surfeited with good things. here is something to suit every age in a household, and they must be a dull lot who are not all set laughing. om Hood— who inherits so much of his fathers genius — acts as editor, and that fact is a sufficient guarantee of the merit of "Five Alls ;" but there is also a number of well-known writers, who have philosophy, wit, wisdom, entertainment, and fun to offer. he total result is 100 pages of the most acceptable kind ever offered for a shilling. * "Warnes Christmas Annual: Five Alls."
