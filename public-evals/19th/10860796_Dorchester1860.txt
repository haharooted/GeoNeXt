STTmiMBKT.—Mat 1,1862.] DORSET COUNTY CHRONICLE AND SOMERSETSHIRE GAZETTE.  we have seen an engraving of the Guildhall elevation, issued by the architect B. Ferrey, Esq., * showing the proposed addition of a clock tower, 1862,” which completely realises our vision of a full development of the great nasal feature in question. But it is not a “ tower.” Mr. Ferrey is wrong. It is a turettelle merely, ascending from the projecting angle of the building on an external pier or shaft, hexagonal apparently, with a basement of deflected cope mouldings, and carrying on a level with the upper windows an en« largement in the shape of a clock turret, springing from an ornamental cusp, and in the upper compartments of two, out of its three visible faces, exhibiting clock faces to the west and south. his tall and elegant object is carried up to such a height as to render these clock faces visible, we believe, from most parts of the town and vicinity. It terminates in a spire and dog vane, which, far from putting the poor little solitary belfry perched on the centre of the roof oat of countenance, nobly keeps it company, and with the finials and dog vanes at the extremities of the building, produces against the sky line one of those pointed and clustered effects so characteristic of the vagaries of this style of architecture, as seen in the Belgian towns. In short, without affecting the modesty of our civic edifice, this accession completes its outward embellishment. here, surely, cannot be another word to be said. hose who, like ourselves, have not hitherto surveyed with attention the propriety of the step now contemplated, will at once be convinced of it by a glance at the design, which the Mayor or any member of the committee will show them. And we feel satisfied that, without loss of time, every one who has the least regard for Dorchester will put down bis or her subscription that this great and manifest improvement may be effected handsomely and at once.
