CHRISTCHURCH.  RESTORATION OF THE PRIORY Citraca.--The work of restoration of this fine old priory church is making steady progress under the superintendence of Mr. rre], the well-known architect of London. Ihe grand north porch has been completed, with it, groining faithfully restored • a lozenge tiling, red and black, has been laid down, but the ironwork gates remain to be added. he interior of the north transept, the Norman arcade, and fine series of decorated windows in the south aisle of the nave, and the window in the apsidal chapel of the south transept have been restored. he large east window of the north choir-aisle has been filled with stained glass by Lavers and Barraud, the gift of Admiral Walcott, M.P. for the borough. It is now proposed to make use of the large triforia of the nave for congregational accommodation ; to remove the flat ceiling of the lantern and expose the old timber roof, and, at the same time, open the roof of the south transept, and throw down the block of masonry which divides thel latter from its chapels. If the triforia were in use the galleries of the transept might be taken down and the organ moved under the west tower arch, while a perish chancel might be formed under the lantern,— an arrangement indispensable on the score of ritual propriety. Stained glass and encaustic tiles could render the choir one of the most beautify! in England. £3,000 nave already been spent upon the works, but external help is urgently desired for their completion, as the population is neither large nor affluent.
