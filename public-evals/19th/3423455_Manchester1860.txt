  A Umelogu is arravged and will shortly take jplace, between the Hon. J4J*»tnor Warron, Uiiid daughter of Lord ami Ladydu Tanky, aud Mr. Leigh ton, < eldest son of Sir Baldwin Leigliton. .Old. Wrathrr ProphkoieS.—A Freneli almanack for 1774 oontains the following forecasts:—"The coldest winters are those which begin about the Epiphany," the 6th of January. he Feast of St. Peters Chair is on the 18th ; and the old almanack says: -"On tho chair of the good St. Peter the winter quits us or grows colder." . he 17th of January is the FeaSt of St. Antony—" The days when St. Antony.comes are longer by a monks dinner"—that is, the time spent by the monk in eating it. St Vincent is commemorated on the 22nd, and the almanack says, "Take cara.of St. Via cent,, fox if on his day you see tbe sun clear and fine we shall have urn re wine than water." his, I suspect, is the reason why wine growers-have taken St. Vincent for their patron saint. he conversion of St. Paul is celebrated on the 2f>th, and we are told in rude doggreL " When St. Pauls day is five we may look out fr r a good year. If it be windy we shall have war. If it Bn- w or rain we shall have dearness everywhere; aud if tie atmosphere be thick and foggy it denotes gieat mortality."
