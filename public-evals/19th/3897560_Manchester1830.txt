HE POSTAGE PROJECT.  (From the John Bull.) he post-office bubble, it will be seen, has burst; he blessing to the poor, who could neither read nor nite, even if they had time, has vanished, and a new Sign of stupidity and braggadocio has been made manifest.  When Mr. Goulburn, in the House of Commons, Addled Mr. Rowland Hills vast absurdity into holes, the ministerial papers w ere loud in their abuse of such illiberally. he farce went on; not only was Mr. Hill honoured", but salaried; and not only that, his plan was matured even to the sticking of bits of paper on the letters with gum, and paste, and wafers, &C, details so puzzled the wiseacres of Downing-street, that they actually advertised rewards to anybody who c°uld help them in their arrangements as to how to stick best and longest. he revenue, of course, was n°t to suffer, because what is one penny to pay for postage; and then franks were to be abolished, and then the whole world were to be employed in writing letters all day, and night. It will be "recollected that about three weeks since, We ventured to observe that the fine scheme never Oovld be perfected. A postponement being talked of, We mentioneel the first of April as a fit day for the Start, but we knew it must fail. Anybody who read the article in the last Quarterly Review, must see that Mr. Hills plan was wholly impracticable and absurd. Even before reading that, we knew it was impracticable, and it is abandoned. A much more rational rate of postage is adopted, and we are quite satisfied ; hut all the flaming puffs about the benefit to the poor, ■nd the genius of the scheme, must be put down. We have received several letters expressive of different °pinions on the subject; but the point is, the utter failure of ministers in another of their great schemes. We ought to do Lord Lichfield the justice to say that believe he never had a second opinion on the subject; it was purely a Treasury job, and intended to be kept so.
