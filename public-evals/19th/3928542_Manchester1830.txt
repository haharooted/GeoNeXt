WHIG CANDOUR AND VERACITY, THE LATE CONSERVATIVE MEETING AT LIVERPOOL.  ( Frovgme Sun.j The Conservatives associated for the defence of the established church, were edified on Friday last, by three most brilliant " blood and thunder" orations, delivered by the Rev. Messrs. Boyton and OSullivan, 11 Apostolic Deputies" from the most meek Orange Clubs of Ireland. he reception which these gentlemen met with among the Liverpool Tories was every way worthy of both parties ; and the mountebank orators, aware that they were regarded as phenomenons, took care not to disappoint the expectations of the gaping audience. Mr. Boyton led the way in a speech including every topic within and beyond the reach of human comprehension. He railed at the late ministry; blackguarded Daniel OConnell, the Papists, the Catholic bishops, and the Pope ; praised the king, lauded the Duke of Wellington, and adored the Tories ; thanked the Conservatives for their promptitude, and praised the ladies for the beauty of their persons, and their critical discrimination in all theological questions. Mr. OSullivan followed in a strain still more original, which he kept up without intermission for four hours ! It is needless to observe that the meeting was greatly edified and instructed by the speeches of these celebrated orators, which included a history ofthe whole world in general, and of Ireland in particular. At the conclusion of every three sentences, there was either reiterated cheering or a cry of horror, as the description happened to turn on the downfal of the Whigs, or the expatriation of the Protestants. We only lament that the tithe-ridden Catholics of Ireland were not all present on this most memorable occasion, as Dr. Boytons speech could not have failed to convince them that tithes are among the greatest blessings of that unhappy country. For our own part we cannot but regret that there are persons in this country weak and ignorant enough to encourage such mountebank exhibitions on the part of the clergy. he Conservatives may rely upon it, that the church will not long continue to stand, if the ministers of religion thus defend the gross abuses of the establishment. Such conduct in a priest is disgraceful to the sacred character with which he is invested, and a desecration of the altar and the throne, of whose rights he presumes to call himself the advocate. In no other country in the world would such priestly exhibitions be tolerated.
