DORSETSHIRE.  Isle of Portland.—P/wra/iffez.—As the friends and supporters of the Established Church, we are happy to record the following instance of disinterestedness and sense of duty of a Clergyman in this Diocese, whose exam pie, we trust, will be copied by many other Pluralist*. he Rev. C. E. North, Hector of Child Okeford, and of the Isle of Portland, finding that he could not perform the duties of both parishes, voluntarily sent in his resignation of the living of Portland to the Patron, the Bishop of Winchester, who, with a discernment so characteristic of his lordship in the patronage and employment of pious and able Ministers, immediately appointed the Rev. J. Harrington as Mr. North’s successor, under a promise of residence. o this condition the new Rector willingly consented, and as there had not been, from time immemorial, a Parsonage House, immediately purchased a recently built house in the very of the Island, and brought his wife and family to reside in it. he Islander* have now full duty twice every Sunday in the Church, which is now filled with a very attentive congregation. he Pastor is beloved by his flock, while the Temporal at well as Spiritual con. dition of all orders ot men in the Island was never better attended to. An excellent Surgeon is also established on the Island; and a public Dispensary supported by voluntary contributions, and patronized by his present Majesty, who is a liberal subscriber to its funds, and promises to be of the greatest comfort and advantage to the numerous poor on the Island. Mr. Harrington, on leaving the Island of Guernsey, where he had resided four years as one of the Ministers of St James’s Church, was presented by his congregstion, as a mark of their esteem and approbation of his services, with a purse of 60 Sovereigns, and a handsome Silver Salver.
