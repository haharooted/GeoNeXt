PARSLEY PEEL.  In Peel’s private house, experiments though of a homelier sort, were also carried on. On one occasion, we are told, the manufacturer himself wa* working in his kitchen, designing patterns and planning how best to print them off, when his little daughter ran off to the herb garden and brought back a sprig of parsley. With a child’s eloquence she pointed out its beauty and begged him to use it as a pattern. he hint was promptly acted upon. &■ pewter dinner-plate was at once taken down from the dresser, and father arid daughter between them roughly sketched a figure of the leaf, which served for a first experiment. It was soon copied and improved upon. Nancy’s pattern, as it was known in the family* became a favourite among calico-buyers, and because of it the father obtained the nickname, throughout Lancashire, of Parsley Peel.—•‘Old Robert Peel at Blackburn," in English Merchants.
