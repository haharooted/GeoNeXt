HE LATE LORD COLCHESTER  he House of Lords has lost one of its most respected members by the decease of Admiral Lord Colchester, which took place, after a lingering illness, early on Friday morning, at his lordships house in Berkeley-square, in his 69 sh year. he late Lord Colchester was the eldest and only surviving son of the Right Hon. Charles Abbot raised to the peerage in 1817, by the title of Baron Colchester on his retirement from the chair of Speaker of the House of Commons, which he filled with great dignity and general approbation during a period of fifteen years. he late lord entered the royal navy at an early age, and rose to the command of the Alceste, frigate, which vessel, after conveying Lord Amherst and his embassy to China in 1818, was unfortunately wrecked on its return to England. At the time of his decease Lord Colchester was on the list of retired admirals • but he took a lively concern in everything relating to the honour and interests of the service, and was intimately acquainted with every branch of naval administration. As a politician he was firmly and consistently attached to the Conservative party, but without narrow or factious views; and while his calm judgment gave him weight and authority with his friends, the moderation of his sentiments and the uniform suavity of his manners always commanded the respect of his opponents. During Lord Derbys former administration Lord Colchester filled with credit the office of Postmaster-General, in which his accurate habits of business and sterling sense were justly appreciated by his colleagues and the public. In 1836 he married the Hon. Elizabeth Susan Law, second daughter of Eiward Lord Ellenborough, Lord Chief Justice of England. In private life he was universally esteemed.—Standard.
