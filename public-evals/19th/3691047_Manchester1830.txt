ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.  South Nottinghamshire—Sir Robert Howe Bromley, with a feeling which does him high honour rather than risk the chance of effecting a victory for an adherent of the present ministry, by causing a division among politicalfriends, has withdrawn from the contest, and thus made a noble sacrifice of personal feeling, in order to promote, as he well says, "a cordial union among all Protestant Conservatives," and to secure an important triumph of those principles of which the  public-spirited baronet has always been a most strenuous supporter. he true friends of the constitution will now, we trust, anxiously combine their energies to promote the return of Lord Lincoln and Colonel Rolleston. Better or more efficient members cannot be found—Nottingham Journal. Lord Powerscourt, nephew of the Earl of Roden, is about to be brought forward, in conjunction with Mr. Ludlow Bruges, by the Conservative interest, for the representation of Bath. His lordship is in his 23d year. Mr. Oliphant, M.P., for Perth, having intimated that he would not again request their suffrages in the event of a new election, a meeting of the liberal electors was held on Tuesday, at which a requisition inviting the Hon. Arthur Kinnaird, brother to Lord Kinnaird, to stand as a candidate for the representation, was numerously signed. Leith.— We understand that in consequence of expected changes in the law courts, and the immediate elevation of the Lord Advocate to a seat on the bench, a numerous body of the electors in Leith are about to propose the Hon. James Erskine M urray, of Aberdona, as member for the district, in the event of a vacancy taking place.
