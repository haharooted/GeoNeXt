CORFE CASTLE.  Shipping Disastbb.â€”A little smack called the Zouave, of Ryde, Isle of Wight, 43 tons burden, foundered in the St. Albans Race, some six miles from the Head, at about half-past five on Tuesday morning, the 6th inst. She was bound from Portland to Ryde, laden with Portland block ; and, when off the place indicated, she encountered a heavy sea, in which she sank. he crew, consisting of the captain, Mr. homas Dallimore, who is the sole owner, and another seaman, made their escape in the boat, which was almost swamped on nearing the shore; but, by the assistance of the coastguard, the poor fellows were landed in safety in Chapmans Pool, near the wreck of the Georgina. hey were taken to a house belonging to one of the coastguard, where their wants were carefully attended to. he captain has been running his little craft to and from Portland for ten years past; but she is not insured. Up to the present moment the Georgina remains in pretty much the same condition as when she was cast upon the rocks. Had the wind and sea, which sunk the Zouave, continued, her destruction would most likely have been completed. All the cargo of any value has been removed.
