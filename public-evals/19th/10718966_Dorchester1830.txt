IPSWICH election.  On the re-assembling of the house in the evening. Mr. Clipperton, who has been so long confined in Newgate for a breach of privilege, was brought to the bar, reprimanded, and discharged. Mr. Hume then moved, in consequence of the evidence adduced be ore the Ipswich election Committee, that T. M. Keith be committed to the custody of the Serjeant at Anns. Some discussion ensued, and the motion was agreed to. Mr. Wason then presented a petition from Mr. Pilgrim, praying that Mr. Keith might be allowed to go to Norwich in custody either of the Serjeant-at-Arms or of the Governor of New- : gate, to give evidence upon his ( Pilgrim’s) trial. Lord Stormont said that he should advise not to go on with the prosecution against Pilgrim, as it whs clear (hat, after what the house had done to prejudge the case by taking Mr. Keith into custody, the prosecution must be a mere farce. Mr. S. Kice suggested the postponement of the subject till tomorrow ; to which Mr. Wason did not object, but he moved that Pilgrim’s petition be printed. his was opposed by Mr Frcshfield. on the ground that it would operate unfavorably against Mr. Keith, by making the fact public, that he was so conscious of his innocence that he even petitioned the house to have his prosecutor examined. he Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the house ought to proceed on its own judgment of what was right, without looking to partial consequences The petition, however, was not ordered to be primed, but was ordered to be brought under consideration to morrow.
