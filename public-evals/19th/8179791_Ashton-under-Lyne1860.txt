0H WILLIE WE HAVE MISSED YOU.  Oh! Willie we hare missed yon, For you hare tamed long; We’ve not enjoyed a single meal. Nor heard the evening song. u went away at early morn, But where you did hot say. And sad were all our anxious hearts At closing of the day. he gloomy night kept wearing on. And still you did not come— Oh ! Willie we have missed you. Welcome, welcome home.* But what is this that movesroe, And startles my repose ? Yon cannot be my Willie dear. on wear not Willies clothes. Ah! now I see with joy and pride, You’ve joined the rifle corps, Prepared to hold your liberty. As our fathers did of yore. I do not wish that you should be Compelled from me to roam— OhWillie you have pleased me, Welcome, welcome home. But who has been your tailor To deck you out so gay, So bravely and becomingly In soldier-like array? our clothes are made with taste and skill. he fabric good also; And manfully you’ll lock, my love, If to the field you go. But oh, I should be very sad If were compelled to part— Oh! Willie I should miss you, The comfort of my heart Dear love, our honest tailor Lives in our own good town, And for his skill and promptitude Has won a just renown. For cheapness he is not excelled— The best that eer was worn, By soldier or civilian, Is the clothing of KILLOHN. His mart is now threefold enlarged. And grand is the display, So there the people all should haste Without the least delay.
