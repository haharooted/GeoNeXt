SCOTLAND.  Extraordinary Lunacy Case. A seven days jury trial was concluded at Edinburgh on Friday laßt, in which Mr. Angus Macintosh, of Holme, a proprietor in Invernessshire, in possession of estates yielding him several thousands a year, sought £5,000 damages from Dr. John Smith and Dr. Lowe, proprietors of Saughton-Hall Asylum, a first-class private institution for the insane, on the ground of wrongous and illegal detention there. he detention took place so far back as from the 13th of June to the 20th of July, 1852, when, through connivance of one of the keepers, Mr. Macintosh succeeded in escaping. An action was brought against the defenders in 1853, but was abandoned, and a similar suit was at the same time instituted against Drs. Glover and Weir, who signed the medical certificate, and Mr. Hugh Fraser, writer to the Signet, who applied to the sheriff for a warrant for the pursuers confinement. On the 29th of July, 1859, after a five days trial, the jury returned an unanimous verdict that the pursuer was insane at the time, and was justifiably sent to the asylum and detained there. he present action against his custodiers was instituted °nly in May, 1863, and now came to trial. he jury were absent about three hours, and returned a verdict hy nine to three in favour of the defenders, a recent statute in Scotland enabling a divided jury in Scotland to give a verdict by three-fourths of their number alter three hours deliberation. he verdict was received in court with loud cheering and some hissing.
