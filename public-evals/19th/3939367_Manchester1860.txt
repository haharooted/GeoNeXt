Statute Hirings. In July hist several meetings were held in the midland counties with a view to secure the abolition of statute hirings, and the substitution therefor of register offices. As far as Warwickshire was concerned it was resolved that the members of the committee then appointed by Lord Leighs suggestion should distribute blank forma amongst the landholders in the different divisions, for the purpose of getting as many signatures as possible in favour of this proposal, in order to obviate the evils of drunkenness, and worse species of immorality which the magistrates find regularly follow " statutes" or " mops," at which servants are hired in the open streets. A meeting to receive a report of the result was held at Warwick on Saturday last, at which there were present Lord Leign. Mr. Adderley, M.P., and several other zealous supporters ot the movement, when it was stated that eighty of tne tenant farmers of the county had given their- signatures in pledge of their extermination no longer to hire in thu waj. Some had refused to give their signatures because they would not pledge themselves, and it was, £JsrfaX solved to make such an alteration » the forms of subscription as would meet their views of the case. he hiring business, it should be mentioned, at the mops has considerably diminished since the ab»ve movement began.
