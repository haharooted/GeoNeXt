NAVAL AND MILITARY.  Rumoured Retirement of Sir Hcoh Rose.— It is strongly rumoured at the clubs that Sir Hugh Rose is about to resign his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of her Majestys forces in Bengal, and that Sir Hope Grant will be his successor.—United Service Gazette.  A number of officers and others from Woolwich garrison went down to Shoeburyness on Tuesday, to be present at the removal and official examination ordered to take place of the Whitworth target, recently battered, as detailed in the Times. he target was taken to pieces in their presence, and was examined with much care, in order to ascertain the precise nature of the effect produced. Mr. Whitworth predicted that the timber backing, behind the armour, would be found very much shattered by the explosion of his shells. he examination, however, as stated yesterday at Woolwich by the officers present, showed that no serious injury was done to the wooden backing, although it was a good deal shattered by the shock and by the fragments of the plate forced into it. he injury spreads no further, and is manifested in no way different to that produced by solid shot. In fact, no visible effects, it is aaid, of an extraordinary kind have been produced by the Whitworth shell beyond the increased penetratiou which it has effected.
