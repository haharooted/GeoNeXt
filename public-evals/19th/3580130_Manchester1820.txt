DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN LONDON.  On Saturday mornjng, about one oclock, a dreadful fire broke out in the house of Mr." Roland, occupied as a lodging-house for gentlemen, No. 42, Jermyn-street, which, in a few minutes, excited tbe utmost consternation in the neighbourhood : so rapid was the increase of the flames, that the whole premises soon became one entire blaze from the lower to the upper part of the building, the flakes of fire issuing at the same time, wilh the utmost velocity, through the windows, which had a most awful and terrific appearance. he destructive conflagration soon extended its dreadful ravages to an adjoining house, kept by two elderly ladies, named Groves, and also to the premises ot Mr. Hazard, a fruiterer, on the other side, which burnt a considerable time with great fury. A vast number of engines were quickly on the spot, assisted by the firemen ; and, although a plentiful supply of water had been speedily procured from the various plugs, which flowed in torrents down the street, all their exertions to save the burning buildings were unavailing, and it was with great perseverance that the other buildings escaped destruction. We hear not an article was saved from the house of Mr. Roland, and what property was secured from the premises of Mrs.. Groves is entirely useless. Of the former building nothing remains but the bare walls, and the latter is conipje(ejy gutted. Considerable damage has been done to thP back premises pf several houses situated in Piccadilly. It is a pleasure, however, t° state, that no lives were tost, notdid we hear of a single accid«nt occurring.
