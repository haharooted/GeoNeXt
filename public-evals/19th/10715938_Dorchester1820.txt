ETSHIRE GAZETTE.  Hje Rev. John Parsons moved a vote of thanks to the Branches, and the Ladies Associations.  he Rev. Godhart seconded the proposition in a speech replete with Christian feeling. It would, he said, have been more gratifying to him to have listened in silence, but he should be sorry if that silence had been construed into coldness for the cause for he warmly felt at his heart a zeal and an interest in the work. He trusted they were all met there with an earnest desire for the real success of the cause. He used the words “ real success,” because he hoped they did not so much measure their success by the number of the members, the state of the funds, or even by the number of copies of the Holy Scriptures which were disseminated, as by the holy faith—the genuine Christian humility which should characterize those who supported the work, and were engaged in its labours, and by the blessing of Ood which was bestowed upon their exertions. he motion was carried unanimously. he Chairman having left the chair, it was taken by William Williams, Esq., and The Rev. A. Hrandram, with an introductory speech, proposed the thanks of the meeting to the Right Hon. the Earl of I)igby, for his attention to the business of the day. he Rev. gentleman expressed a hope, that every blessing might attend his Lordship, that he might feet the blessing of the Bible within himself, and then he would never regret that he had presided over the Dorset Auxiliary Bible Society. his motion wss seconded by the Rev. Mr. Bridges, and carried unanimously.—A very liberal collection was made.
