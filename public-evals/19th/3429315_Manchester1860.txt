RETURN OF DR. LIVINGSTONE.  REPORTED ARRIVAL IN LONDON. "The public, writes Sir R. Murchison, " will be glad to learn that thi great African traveller will shortly be at home. By a leter which I have just received from him, and which was fnished at Malta on the 17th inst., I learn that he reachec Bombay on the 13th of June, after a voyage of 42 dayi from Zanzibar in his own little steamer, the Lady Nyassi. Far from being downcast at the failure of the eforts hitherto made to check the slave trade on the east coast of Africa, my dauntless and energetic friend writes that he 4 cannot find it in his heart to abandon his object. He is. therefore, bent upon returning to Africa, afttr a stay of about four months at home, during which tine he will consult friends on the subject of those future huours in which he purposes to employ his steamer, now left at Bombay. Of this vessel, built at his own expense for river and lake navigation chiefly, Dr. Lvingstone writes :—The Lady Nyassa is a first-rate little sea-beat, and she rose like a duck on the huge waves of the ocean. he projected new expedition of Dr. Livingstone is not, he says, so much exploration, as to set ii train operations by merchants and others by which ths slave trade shall be eventually worked out. I trust that at the meeting of the British Association, to be held at Bath on the 14th of September, this truly disinterestsd and good man will give us an account of his last bold adventures." he Observer of yesterday is informed that Dr. Livingstone arrived at the Customsßaggage Warehouse, Charingcross Railway, London, at a quarter past seven oclock on Saturday evening, having travelled by the express train from Paris. he doctor was looking in excellent health. he distinguished traveller was received with marked respect by the officials of the customs and the railway.
