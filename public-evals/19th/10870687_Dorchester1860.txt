JAMAICA.  Kingston, March 10.—The Commissioners have been sitting every day during the last fortnight, and have taken evidence upon the Gordon case, the state of the island at the time of the outbreak, and the conduct of the naval and military men employed in suppressing it. Mr. Russell Gurney, Q.C., has sat for four days by himself at Bath. He examined a hundred and fifty witnesses, who spoke to acts of excess committed by the Maroons during martial law. he naval and military officers have all been examined. heir evidence was extremely satisfactory, and went to contradict a great part of the evidence given by the negro witnesses. he evidence as to the state of the island occupied three days. No proof was given, or was attempted to be given, of the existence of an organised combination to overthrow the established authority ; but it has been made abundantly clear that at the time of the outbreak there was a widespread spirit of disaffection, and a general disposition and preparedness to join the insurgents. It is expected that the inquiry will come to a conclusion in ten or twelve days. Gordon Ramsay, the provost marshal, has been brought before the magistrates on the charge of the murder of Marshall. He was defended by Mr. Williams, tbe advocate general, and, after deliberation and hearing the evidence and the arguments of counsel, the summons was dismissed. he magistrates sat with closed doors, and assigned no ground for their decision. he day afterwards Ramsay was again arrested, upon a warrant issued by the Attorney General, for the same offence. He has been bailed in £1,000 by Dr. Hamilton, a member of the Executive Committee. His trial will not come on for three months.
