SERIOUS COLLISION IN THE MERSEY.  ONE OF THE ABYSSINIAN TRANSPORTS DAMAGED. Yesterday afternoon, about three oclock, a serious collision occurred in the Mersey. he paddle-steamer Ruby, built for a blockade runner, but recently purchased by the Tuikisb government for a despatch boat, was making a turn to go down the river for a trial trip, when, by some blunder in navigation, she was laid directly across ihe bow of the screw transport City of Dublin (ore cf the Inmaa line), then lying at anchor off the landing-stage, with her steam np and ready to start at night time for Bombay. he strength of the ebb tide carried the Ruby with great force athwart-hawse of the screw-steamer, the two vessels getting locked fast together. hey began to drift rapidly down towards the mouth of the river, when a fleet of tug-boats put off from the Princes landing-stage, and after half an hours work extricated them. he starboard paddle-wheel of the Ruby was disabled, and the second of her four funnels carried, away. In consequence the trip had to be postponed, and she was anchored off the Birkenhead docks. he City of Dublins head gear, bowsprit, figure-head, and cutwater were carried away, but her main stem was uninjured. Her departure, however, will be delayed for suae diys.
