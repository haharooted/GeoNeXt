HURSDAY, Jo4NUAItY 6, 1960.  HE POOLE HA RBOUR QUESTION.  It would appear that the inhabitants Of Poole—and we may add of the district deriving so large a portion of their trade through its agency—are at length aroused in earnest to the state of the Harbour and Channel. Ia the fourth page of our paper will be found an  advertisement of a public meeting to be holden on Monday next, in order to memorialise the several departments of her Majestys Government on this truly important subject, and in the third page an abstract of the present condition of the Harbour, the steps sugreted at various periods for itsamendmeut,and the plan now recommended by J. Coode, Esq., the engineer for the Portland Breakwater, for the same object. o these are appended a copy of Mr. Coodes report, and a still more important document to which we recommend minute attention—a report of the royal commission recently appointed to survey the harbours of refuge, de., in which they suggest to the government the adoption of the very measure which has been for so long a period the object of the local authorities, namely the loan of certain sums of money in aid of such purposes. In addition to the information thus conveyed will bo found a small chart of the locality, with a projection of the proposed remedy. Farther notice in this place would be simply a repetition, as the matter will be found treated of at length in the portion of our paper before adverted to, and to this we earnestly request the attention of our readers.
