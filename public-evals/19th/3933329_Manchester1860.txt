FRACAS IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.  SIR R. PEEL SUMMONED. (From Saunderss Newsletter.) A summons has been issued against Sir Robert Peel, at the instance of Mr, Robert Gray, retired banker, formerly of College-green, who complains that the right hon. baronet used language calculated to lead to a breach of the peace towards him on Friday whilst travelling to town by the Dublin and Kingstown Railway. here are, of course, several versions as to the origin of the transaction, and also as to the precise language which Mr. Gray alleges Sir Robert used towards him; but there is no doubt that somethirg unpleasant did occur, in the presence of two of our leading citizens, who happened to be in the carriage at the time, and that Mr. Giay, on his arrival in town, immediately proceeded to the Lead-office and obtained a summons against the chief secretary, and also a summons to secure the attandanee, as a witness, of one of the gentlemen who were in the carriage. One statement is that Mr. Gray, at Salt-hill station, objected to Sir Robert placing some luggage in the carriage in which he was seated, and that Sir Robert having insisted on retaining the luggage there, Mr. Gray complained to the porter on the arrival of the train at the next station, and insisted on having the luggage removed, whereupon Sir Robert used the language as alleged. he case will be investigated before the magistrates iu a few days.
