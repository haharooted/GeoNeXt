HE COLONIES.  Sir C. Colville, the governor of the Mauritius, lias issued an address respecting the orders in council for the modification of the slave system, which has excited a great ferment throughout the island. he memorandum of the governor appears to have originated in a refusal on the part of the proprietors to allow the protector of slaves to communicate the new laws to three of the most intelligent slaves on the estates in each district. he inhabitants memorialized the governor on the subject; and his grace, whilst he says little on the authority clainiwl by the protector, takes occasion to reason with the memorialists on the expediency of the modifications proposed to be introduced 11 into all the sugar colonies possessed by his Majesty,‚Äù and recommends them not to be influenced by vaiu fears, nor to let the slaves acquire an unfounded notion, insinuated by the memorialists in their address, that the English government had censured the local administration of the colonies for having done too much in their favour. His excellency, in conclusion, points to some regulations in progress for strengthening the internal police, but more particularly the cordial co-operation of the colonists themselves, as affording good grounds for anticipating the future prosperity and tranquillity of the colonies.
