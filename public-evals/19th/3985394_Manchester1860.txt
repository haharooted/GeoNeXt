ARRIVAL OF THE THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AT KNOWSLEY.  His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, Commanderin-Chief, arrived at Knowsley Hall yesterday evening, accompanied by his equerry, Colonel Tyrwhitt. He left Euston-square in the 11 20 a.m. train and reached Huyton Station shortly before six oclock. Carriages from the hall were in waiting and the Duke at once drove off, arriving at the ball about five minutes past six oclock. He will occupy the royal apartments in which the Prince and Princess of Wales were looated two years ago, and which was also used by the Queen of the Netherlands on her recent visit. Amongst the distinguished guests who also arrived at Knowsley last evening were Lord Hyde (son of Lord Clarendon), Col. Wilbraharn, Earl and Countess of Delamere, Lady Ellesmere, Colonel Wilson, Mrs. and Miss Patten, Lord and Lady Colville, Lord and Lady Barrington, Miss Bwrington, Miss Wilbraham, and Lord William Poulet. His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge will proceed to Preston to-day to open the New Town-hall and the Avenham and Miller Parks, but it is not at all likely that he will be accompanied by the Earl of Derby, whose state of health forbids any exposure to cold.
