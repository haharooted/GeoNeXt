SIR, I have the honor to inform you that on my return j from Heligoland, in pursuance of y.our order*, on ! he 29th instant, that island bearing E. I N. distant tv*vi;ty-three leagues, I was so fortunate as to fall in With the Jena French cute.r privateer, of fourteen guns, (ten mounted) two. four, and eight pounders, and twenty-nine men, just on the point of taking Che brig Perseverance of Jiarmoath, from London, with a cargo of very considerable value. Having deceived the privateer by dispaving the Danish Ting, 1 was luckily suffered to approach him, near enough J to rendu- fruitless his subsequent ende.tvouis to es- : cape ; and 1 consider myself the more hippy in Ins j capture, from his being destined to cruise in the track of Heligoland, where he was likely alter the gales to 1 have done great mischief to the trade of His Majes- i tys subjects, I beg to add, that I have thought it j my duty to convoy the F.nglish merchant vessel sale ! o this place, it being the port ol her destination. he Jena was fitted out at Amsterdam, and sailed the preceding day, but had not taken any thing. I have the honour to be, &c. (Signed) ROBT. FORBES.
