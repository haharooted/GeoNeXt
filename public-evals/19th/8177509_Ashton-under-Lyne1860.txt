GARIBALDI AND CAVOUR.  he Times, in a leader on Garibaldi’s demands upon Sardinia, says That he dislikes Cavour is well known. hat he dislikes him for his diplomacy and his cession of Nice, and, possibly, also for the unworthy manner in which he has sometimes treated Garibaldi, we are not now to be told. hat he should be determined not to give np Sicily and Naples to be trafficked for between Cavour and the Emperor of the French is very natural. Great as Garibaldi is, he is not more necessary to the success of the revolution now tending to its accomplishment than Cavour is. here is some equivocal work yet to be done, which Garibaldi cannot do. All the old symptoms of compensation and annexation are reappearing. here can be no sufficient reason for this open strife.
