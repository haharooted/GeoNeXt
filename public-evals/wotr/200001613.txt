San Francisco, Cal., September 12, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel HARVEY LEE,

Fourth Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding Benicia Barracks, Benicia, Cal.:

SIR: You will please read and hand the inclosed letter as directed. The department commander desires you to let the people understand generally that the order of the President suspending the writ of habeas corpus and directing the arrest of all persons guilty of disloyal practices will be rigidly enforced. Those of them who are leading secessionists will be confined at Alcatraz; those who may happen to be drunken brawlers, or if no account, will be confined in your guardhouse unless they take the oath of allegiance. Practices injurious to the Government or offensive to the loyal sentiment of the people will under no circumstances be permitted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
