[Inclosure M.] HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENTR OF NEWE MEXICO, August 10, 1862.

To the ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Washington, D. C.:

General Carleton's force in the Mesilla will be less by 700 men than is stated in my report of the 6th. He reports that he can be followed by another regiment of infantry or more. I recommend that one regiment of infantry and five companies of cavalry be ordered from California. The regular troops can be ready to leave as soonas the answer to my report of the 6th is received, or earlier if I find it safe to move them.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Brigadier-General.
