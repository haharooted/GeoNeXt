NAVY DEPARTMENT,

Washington, May 31, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith a copy of a dispatch from Rear-Admiral D. G. Farragut, dated the 9th instant, in which he states as his opinion that if two 15-inch guns are placed on the Old Spanish Battery at Barrancas, and two in an earth-work on the beach on the western front of Fort Pickens, the port of Pensacola will be rendered safe against the attacks of almost any enemy, and to request that prompt measures may be taken by the War Department to carry out the suggestion of Rear-Admiral Farragut.

Very respectfully,

GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy.
