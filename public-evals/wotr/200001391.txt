HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 26, 1864.

Captain CAMERON,

Commanding, Cassville, Mo.:

The troops arriving at Cassville need to feed and rest a little. General Holland will leave here at 1 o'clock and come directly through. Troops need not be moved unless there is an emergency till he arrives. Gather all the information you can for him. I send him instead of coming myself, because he is acquainted with all the roads and country. A sufficient force will be kept at Cassville to hold the place.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
