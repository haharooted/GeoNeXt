[Inclosure H.] HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO, Santa Fe, N. Mex., August 12, 1865.

Brigadier General JAMES H. CARLETON,

Commanding Column from California, District of Arizona:

GENERAL: I have just received your communication of the 8th instant. It is my wish that you should exercise your own judgment both with regard to the distribution of your troops and the point at which your headquarters will be established. My instructions to Colonel Chivington of June 22 and subsequent dates were predicated upon the supposition that he would meet with some resistance, and were more in detail than I should have considered necessary with an officer of more experience. In my letter of yesterday I gave the general tenor of my instructions, in order thatyou might use your discretion in carrying out the policy of the Government with reference to this department. Directions will be given to send tents to Fort Craig for the use of your command, and I trust that you will not hesitate in askingfor anything that will add to the comfort of your command. If not already at Fort Craig, it will be sent there, and if not now in abundance, we will share wat we havem and renew our supplies when the trains come in. It will probably be necessary for a time to send your own transportation to Fort Craig for any supplies that you may need from that place.

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Department.
