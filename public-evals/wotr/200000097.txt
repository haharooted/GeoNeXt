Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff.

Numbers 2. Report of Major General James E. B. Stuart, C. S. Army.

HDQRS. CAV. CORPS, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, February 24, 1864.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that Major H. W. Gilmor, commanding cavalry battalion, has made a successful attack upon the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

On the night of the 11th instant he, with 20 men, penetrated to the railroad at Brown's Shop, between Kearneysville and Fuffield's Depot, attacked the express train from Baltimore, threw it from the track, disabling the engine and damaging the track. He captured nearly 90 prisoners, but owing to the proximity of the enemy was compelled to abandon them, having taken away their arms. He returned to Mount Jackson without loss, although pursued, as he states, as far as Strasburg by four or five regiments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General.
