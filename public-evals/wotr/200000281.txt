Jefferson City, January 21, 1864.

SAMUEL RUCKER, Esq.,

Pleasant Hill, Cass County, Mo.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 17th instant. I thank you for the information in relation to the state of affairs at Pleasant Hill. The company that is mustered in and armed will be relieved from active duty and permitted to retain their arms for self-protection as soon as the changes in the position of the troops is made. Say to the parties of whom you write who have felt it necessary from motives of policy to sign the petition to which you refer, that the embarrassment under which they labor is fully understood, and that they have nothing to apprehended from me in consequence of being compelled to make an ostensible effort to remain under present military organization.

I wish you, as well as other of your friends, would keep me fully advised of the situation of affairs, and I hope by your assistance to bring about a better state of affairs on the border. You have probably learned that I have asked the General Assembly to pass a law prohibiting the stock from running at large. The object of this is to enable the farmers to till their lands without the necessity of fencing out the stock. Parties with a working team can thus raise sufficient to subsist them. If they have to build fences it cannot be done.

Let me know if my views are correct. With a hearty co-operation on the part of the people, I hope that you will witness the end of your terrible afflictions.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
