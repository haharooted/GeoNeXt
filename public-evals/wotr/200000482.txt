HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
Grand Ecore, April 12, 1864.

Captain PHELPS,

U. S. Navy:

The major-general commanding the department desires me to say that a pontoon bridge is to be laid across the river to-night, and that the barge he understands is in your possession would be of great use in its construction. He requests that you permit is to be used for the purpose.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
