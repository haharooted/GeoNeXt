HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
New Orleans, January 23, 1864

Colonel E. L. MOLINEUX,

Commanding District of La Fourche:

COLONEL: You must destroy all means of communication which the rebels can make use of for disturbance of our lines, where such means are not fully under your control. Communication with the rebel lines must be prevented by all means at your disposal. Owners or agents of plantations through which military railroads and telegraph lines run must be held accountable for malicious interference therewith. Posters containing provisions of Special Orders, Numbers 60, of March 1, 1863, will be furnished you by the superintendent of the telegraph, to be fully posted in your district. You will enforce its provisions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[C. P. STONE.]

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
