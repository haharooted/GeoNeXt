IMMEDIATE.] HEADQUARTERS,

May 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General NEWTON:

GENERAL: I am compelled to send two regiments of infantry to support McCook toward Varnell's as well as to protect my left. Please send down into the valley as many men as you can spare to act as my reserve; can't you communicate with me by signal? I have an officer here and will try it.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
