CHARLESTON, May 10, 1864. (Received 17th.)

General Anderson telegraphs me that another of the enemy's steamers was blown into fragments yesterday by a torpedo in the Saint John's, a short distance below Jacksonville. She had two guns aboard, and was towing a schooner. The latter escaped. Not known how many lives lost. This is the third steamer that has met this fate in the Saint John's within the last forty days.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER.
