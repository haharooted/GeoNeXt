SUMTER, January 3, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that Captain Adams, with 6 officers and 100 men from Sixth, Nineteenth, Twenty-third, and Twenty-eighth Georgia, relieved Captain Butt, 6 officers, and 100 men from Georgia Volunteers. The Ironsides, 4 monitors, 2 mortar-boats, 4 wooden gun-boats (1 of which I have not seen before), 3 tugs, and 14 sailing vessels are inside the bar to-day; 11 crafts in Light-House Inlet, 3 blockaders in front, 1 three-masted, 1 tug, and 2 schooners to the northeast, and 1 large transport and 1 schooner in the offing, going southward. I think that from riggers on the blockaders and on the 2 schooners referred to there is surveying not only the number but the movements of vessels in sight. Large flag-staff raised at Wagner yesterday. Twenty-four-pounder shipped last night. Too much sea on the north wall for shipment of 8-inch. Will do it first calm night if flat is sent.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
