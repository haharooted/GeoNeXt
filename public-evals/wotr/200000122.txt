[Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.]

HEADQUARTERS,
Chaffin's Farm, February 9, 1864.

MAJOR: From information deemed reliable and received last night, the enemy's force recently threatening my front consisted of the following commands: Cavalry, First District of Columbia, Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania, First New York Mounted Rifles, Fifth Pennsylvania, Third New York, and Fifth U. S. Colored Troops; infantry, three regiments negroes, One hundred and thirty-ninth New York, one Delaware regiment, and fifteen pieces of artillery. The enemy, as reported by Colonel Shingler's scouts, passed Slatersville yesterday morning, and he (Colonel Shingler) thinks they are now in Williamsburg. His estimate of their force is 5,000, and Major Robertson's 8,000.

I have heard nothing definite of any movement on the other side of the York River, and I presume there is no danger to the wagon train under Captain Smith, sent for pork to King and Queen. This train consists of thirteen of my best teams, and the loss of it would break me.

Respectfully, &c.,

EPPA HUNTON,

Brigadier-General.
