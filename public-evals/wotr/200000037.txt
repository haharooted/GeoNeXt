HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,
Mill Creek, Ga., May 10, 1864-12 m.

Lieutenant Colonel H. W. PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Twentieth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report concerning the movements of the enemy that I was informed last evening, through the statements of several of the enemy made to a family residing in front of my picket lines, that they designed descending the mountain and attacking us last night. I immediately engaged my entire available force in the construction of breast-works and in obstructing the approaches, and have my position now well protected. This morning they exhibit troops in considerable numbers immediately to the south of the gap, and they have been industriously signaling from a station established on the ridge about a quarter of a mile northward of the gap road. The passage of the mountain is only a road leading over the summit, and, there being no gap, it is improperly designated as such. I am in communication with General Kilpatrick and Colonel Ross.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. W. GEARY,

Brigadier-General.
