HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,
Little Rock, Ark., June 2, 1864.

Captain JUNIUS B. WHEELER,

Chief Engineer, Dept. of Arkansas:

CAPTAIN: Upon examining the works being thrown up at the outer line of defenses, I was (though perhaps from its incomplete state) not favorably impressed with its design, and so expressed myself to the district commander. General Carr has asked for my opinion in writing in regard to it, which cannot be justly given until I can learn from you the true design and profile of the work. If you can allow your assistant, Lieutenant Sommer, to accompany me to the locality at 5 o'clock this afternoon, I shall feel much obliged to you.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
