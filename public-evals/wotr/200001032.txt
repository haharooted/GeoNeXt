HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF PENSACOLA,
Barrancas, June 3, 1864.

Major JOHN LEVERING,

A. A. G., Hdqrs. Defenses of New Orleans:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report, in connecting with my report of May 25 ultimo, Numbers 363, the following additional information received from refugees and deserters:

There are, besides the militia, but very few troops now at Mobile, Colonel C. A. Fuller commanding. A Pollard are only five companies of the Second Alabama Infantry; Colonel Maury has at the Fifteen-Mile Station, Seven-Mile Station, and Turner's Mill about 500 of the Fifteenth Confederate Cavalry, with three pieces of artillery at Fifteen-Mile Station. Three companies of the same regiment are still at and near Milton. The rest of the regiment are on the Perdido. In the Mobile Bay there are outside the Dog River Bar the Tennessee, Baltic, Tuscaloosa, and Huntsville, iron-clad rams, and the wooden gun-boats Selma, Morgan, and Gaines. The Nashville is not yet over the bar, but they have already the camels under her. Two more rams are at Mobile, not yet plated, and one got aground above Mobile while coming down from Selma. Of the four iron plated floating batteries near the dry-dock, one was sunk.

The salt-works at Bonsecours Bay, producing daily over 1,000 bushels for the Confederacy, are now entirely unguarded.

I am very anxious to make immediate use of the small quartermaster steamer Lizzie Davis, sent from New Orleans, although only capable of carrying 200 men, but on her arrival the quartermaster reported her unfit for service, and she is still at the navy-yard repairing. The engineer entertains very little hope of making her serviceable, and I would urgently request to have her replaced by another steamer fit for immediate use.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.
