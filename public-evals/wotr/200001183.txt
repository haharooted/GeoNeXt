HEADQUARTERS OWEN'S RIVER EXPEDITION,
Camp Independence, Cal., September 30, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM, U. S. Army,

Assistant Adjutant-General, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: The order directing me to proceed to Visalia with two companies Second Cavalry California Volunteers did not come to hand until day before yesterday, the 28th. On yesterday, the 29th, I started the command, and will leave here myself to-day and overtake them at the Big Lake. The wagons will hae to go by the way of Walker's Pass ank Keysville (the only wagon road, and that almost impassable), but I shall take one company from the foot of the lake without wagons or packs, the men taking rations in their haversacks, and attempt to travel straight across the mountains into Visalia. I think that I can reach Visalia in this way by the 6th or 7th of October, wilst it would take until the 14th or 15th to go around by the road. I adopt this course for the reason that Doctor George informs me by private letter that there are wagons on the road from Stockton with stores for the command, and it may not be safe to have them in the vicinity of Visalia without troops to guard them. Again, by going across the mountains and geting into Visalia in the night I may possibly catch the notorious traitor Baker, who would be sure to know of my coming and escape if I should go to the road.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. EVANS,

Lieutenant-Colonel Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding
