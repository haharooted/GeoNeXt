2. To facilitate the movement of artillery and cavalry, barges will be fitted up for the transportation of the horse batteries and of cavalry regiments to be towed by the transports carrying troops of those arms. Whenever it is practicable to avoid it the troops will not be separated from their guns and horses, and the arrangements for embarking and disembarking will be made as perfect as possible.

This arrangement will be made: At Memphis, Tenn., for 800 cavalry and one battery; at Vicksburg, Miss., for 1,200 cavalry and two batteries; at New Orleans, La., for 2,000 cavalry and three batteries.

6. Brigadier General T. W. Sherman, U. S. Volunteers, is detailed for special service, and will report by letter to the major-general commanding the division.

By order of Major General E. R. S. Canby:
