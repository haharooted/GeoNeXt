HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,
Denver, Colo. Ter., April 13, 1864.

Captain GEORGE L. SANBORN,

1st Cav. of Colo. Commanding Officer, Camp Sanborn, Colo. Ter.:

SIR: Yours is received giving account of Indian fight.* Surgeon leaves in few minutes. Am sorry Lieutenant Dunn left the Indians at all. Put your force in best trim and avenge the injury done to it. I send to Camp Collins for Hawkins to cut them off; also to Fort Laramie. I now have Lieutenant Eayre on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill after them. They stole 175 head of cattle. You will have to be very vigilant. Carbine cartridges come to you by to-morrow's coach; look out for them that they are not carried past you.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. STILWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
