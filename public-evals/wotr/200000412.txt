HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., April 14, 1864.

General E. B. BROWN,
Warrensburg, Mo.:

Do not arm any of the home guards without great necessity, nor any in places where the leading, thoroughly loyal element is not the basis and satisfied. The basis should be voluntary, if practicable.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
