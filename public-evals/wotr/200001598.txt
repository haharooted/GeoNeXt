CAMP INDEPENDENCE, OWEN'S RIVER EXPEDITION,

September 15, 1862.

Major R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, San Francisco:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that owing to the fact that there are no provisions in the commissary departmetn of this command, I deemed it advisable to order the tents to be struck and the entire command to move toward Los Angeles until we meet a provision train, which is in all probability now on the road for this camp. In the meantime I have authorized Captain T. H. Goodman, acting assistant quartermaster, to purchase such stores for the subsistence of the troops as he may be able to procure in or near Union Camp or Keysville. The command commenced its march at 9 a. m. instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. O'NEILL,

Major, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding.
