SILETZ INDIAN AGENCY, OREG., October 1, 1862.

W. H. RECTOR, Esq.,

Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Salem, Oreg.:

SIR: I would urge upon your immediate consideration the importance of having Fort Umpqua reoccupied by troops. Since the evacuation of that post large numbers of Indians from this agency have availed themselves of the opportunity and fled down the coast to their former homes on Smith's and Rogue Rivers. Had the fort been garrisoned they could not thus have made their escape, for the reason that this fort guards the only road leading from this agency to the country south of the Umpqua River. I am of the opinion that if the fort is not reoccupied most of the coast Indians who reside at this and the Alsea agencies will leave before next spring. The expense of removing to this agency those Indians who will escape and go down the coast will far exceed the cost of maintaining a company of soldiers at Fort Umpqua. That fort is of much more importance to this agency than Fort Hoskins.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. BIDDLE,

U. S. Indian Agent.
