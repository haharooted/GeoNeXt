DANVILLE, June 13, 1864-11. 35 a. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Commanding:

It is reported that squads of rebels are moving through the country north and northwest of Harrodsburg and Perryville. Do not learn of their committing any depredations but getting something to eat for themselves and horses. Many thanks for your dispatch just received. I hope the good part of is true, and more, too. Colonel Weatherford, with a part of his command, has just left Lebanon, moving in this direction.

W. L. GROSS,

Assistant Superintendent, &c.
