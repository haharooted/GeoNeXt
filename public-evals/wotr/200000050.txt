HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FOURTH CORPS, May 9, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

GENERAL: We are just about even with a line of the enemy's works extending east across the valley. We are butt up against the enemy and may not be able to advance farther for some time. I think it would help if you were to echelon across the valley to the east of us. I think you could do it safety. In that event I can inform General Howard at once by signal, and Wood can menace them also on the right. If you prefer it, your command could file with safety along the eastern base of the ridge, and form in echelon afterward according to your judgment.

JOHN NEWTON,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-I think the sooner it is done the better, unless you have some information to the contrary. Please let me know.
