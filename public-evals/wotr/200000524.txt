CULPEPER, VA., April 16, 1864. (Received 1.30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Please ask the President to authorize the transfer of Fort Smith and the Indian Territory to the Department of Arkansas. There is every reason why this Territory and the State of Arkansas should be under one man, and that man in the field. In case this change is made I wish General Blunt ordered back to report to General Curtis.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
