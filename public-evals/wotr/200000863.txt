CHARLESTON, S. C., February 27, 1864.

Prisoners report that it was the U. S. ship of war Housatonic, twelve guns, which was sunk on night 17th instant, by the submarine torpedo-boat, Lieutenant Dixon, of Alabama, commanding. There is little hope of safety of that brave man and his associates, however, as they were not captured.
