HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,
May 10, 1864-8.45 a. m.

Brigadier-General McCOOK,

Commanding Cavalry:

I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that he has seen the deserter from Dalton sent him by you. The general does not believe his story, and thinks he was sent in to tell a lie. We are retiring slowly, without any show of pursuit, to the position we occupied yesterday morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. BASCOM,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
