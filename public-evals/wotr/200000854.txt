FORT SUMTER, January 31, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the firing was continued to-day from the 200-pounder at Gregg and from a 100-pounder in position where the gin was observed yesterday. It was directed against the southwest angle, which is a good deal cut. Much of the work done on it last night still remains. Number of shots, 131; hit, 114; missed, 17. The fleet is unchanged, except in the absence of two blockaders. The nearest monitor was observed to have beams projecting from the sides similar to the Ironsides. No casualties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
