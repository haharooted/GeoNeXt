Major-General BANKS,

New Orleans:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of January 11, inclosing copy of your proclamation, is received.* Major General John A. McClernand has been ordered to report to you for duty. I am directed by the Secretary of War to say that you can assign him to such duty as you may deem best. If you think it advisable to restore him to the command of his former corps, your order will be confirmed by the President.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
