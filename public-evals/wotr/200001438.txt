HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,
Saint Louis, Mo., April 9, 1864.

Major-General STEELE,

Little Rock, Ark.:

Captain Mann's battery of the First Missouri Artillery is under orders for your command. One-fourth of the men are, however, still absent on furlough until the 14th. A complete new battery will be here for him in ten days. His requisition for equipments will not be filled in less than that time. I recommend that he be allowed to wait, and shall so order unless you dissent.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.
