Reports of Brigadier General Egbert B. Brown, U. S. Army, commanding District of Central Missouri.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,
Warrensburg, Mo., February 23, 1864.

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that on the 22nd instant, at 8 a. m., a small squad of guerrillas was attacked by Lieutenant Hamilton, Company D, Fourth Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, under the command of Colonel James McFerran, in which Lieutenant Hamilton was severely but not dangerously wounded; one of the guerrillas was wounded. The enemy's force was part of the notorious Captain Blunt's band, that numbered about 20 men and were driven out of the brush on the Blackwater, about 12 miles northwest of this post. It is the same band that has been reported as being in Jackson County the past four months.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General Volunteers, Commanding.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
