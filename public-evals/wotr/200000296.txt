Springfield, Mo., January 30, 1864.

Lieutenant MORLEY,

Quartermaster, Casville, Mo.:

How many extra horses are there now at Cassville? What is the nearest point to Cassville where horses can be fed? I think I will order the troops back at once if there is no enemy near Berryville.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
