CHARLESTON, July 8, 1864.

Your telegram of to-day received. I have repeatedly called on General Chesnut, but he is unable to fill my requisition. The enemy's attack on this place is formidable and persistent. Firing to-day very heavy. Several of our best guns left flank of works on James Island disabled.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
