YORKTOWN, VA., March 8, 1864.

GENERAL: Twelve men of Dahlgren's party have come in. They state that Colonels Dahlgren and Cooke, with about 80 men and a large number of negroes, were ambushed at King and Queen Court-House on Thursday evening,11 p. m. * The colonel was killed and 7 men wounded. Colonel [Major] Cooke and the remainder were afterward surrounded by the citizens and soldiers on furlough. Colonel [Major] Cooke ordered his men to scatter and make for the river. The negroes were captured and confined in the jail at the court-house. Colonel Dahlgren's servant has also come in. He reports seeing the colonels' body on the roadside stripped of his clothing and horribly mutilated. I sent a large force two days since to King and Queen Court-House. It has not returned.
