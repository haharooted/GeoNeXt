HUNTSVILLE, May 9, 1864.

Major-General McPHERSON:

The following dispatch just received from General J. D. Stevenson, Decatur:

One of my patrols to Shoal Creek is just in. The rebels are there with an outpost of 100 men. Reliable information is to the effect that Roddey has taken Clifton-whether with or without the garrison is now known-and that Forrest's command is marching on to Pulaski. The Huntsville road is clear from Shoal Creek bridge to this place and Florence Ford.

J. S. RING,

Captain, Seventh Illinois, Commanding.

JNO. E. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
