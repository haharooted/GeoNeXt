FEBRUARY 6-10, 1864.-Scout in the Sni Hills, Mo.

Report of Captain Charles F. Coleman, Ninth Kansas Cavalry.

HEADQUARTERS,
Pleasant Hill, Mo., February 11, 1864.

CAPTAIN: After hunting bushwhackers faithfully for four days, I returned late last night to this place, with all the troops under my command. I did not meet with as good success as I had hoped to, but did finally succeed in driving them out of the Sni Hills, in which place I think there were about 200 of them. We found them in parties numbering from 10 to 40, but a running fight out of them, of which kind we had a good many. We took 2 horses from them, wounded 1. They have all gone east and northeast. I intend to bushwhack them when they return.

Captain, Commanding.
