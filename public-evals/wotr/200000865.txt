CHARLESTON, July 7, 1864.

Can I get any re-enforcements? General Johnston sent only 520 men. The enemy is making a heavy demonstrative attack on Charleston. I am husbanding my force in the hope of being re-enforced. If I am told I can get no help I would know better how to act.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER.
