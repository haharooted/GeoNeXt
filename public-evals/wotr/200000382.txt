HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,
Pass Cavallo, Tex., January 18, 1864

General BENTON:

SIR: The major-general commanding desires you to preserve the strictest vigilance in your front and in the direction of the bay. It is not believed that the cotton-clad Carr is destroyed. The engineer, Captain Baker, will visit Indianola to-day to make a reconnaissance and sketch with a view to defensive works. You will keep your picket-lines and vedettes well out and very much on the alert, and will keep them sufficiently strong not only to prevent an attack from without but to make it impossible for individuals to go beyond the lines. Persons offering themselves from without will be allowed to come in and be reported without deadly to these headquarters, but no one will be permitted to pass out without an order from these headquarters.

Respectfully,

HUGH G. BROWN,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
