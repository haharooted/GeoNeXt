LOUISVILLE, KY., June 11, 1864--9. 45 p. m.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

We understand that Frankfort is besieged, and cannonading has been heard most of the day at Bagdad in direction of Frankfort. Where is General Burbridge? Keep me posted. Ample force will be provided.

From dispatches through other quarters it is necessary we have communication with you; if we cannot, we will take care of ourselves. Acknowledge receipt as soon as it is received. It is important.

HENRY B. CARRINGTON,

Brigadier-General.
