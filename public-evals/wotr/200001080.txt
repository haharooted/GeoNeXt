[JUNE 13, 1864. - For Laird to Dickson, reporting operations, see Part I, p. 31.] 
General WASHBURN, Memphis:

Your dispatch [June 12] is received. Under the circumstances, the expedition to Mobile should not be attempted. If General Canby can spare Smith's command, it should go out and meet Forrest, and check him. Al of Polk's command is here, including Loring's and French's DIVISIONS of infantry, as well as three brigades of cavalry, Starke's, Ferguson's and Ross', commanded by Jackson. I don't see what Forrest can have except his cavalry, and the militia under Gholson. They should be met and defeated at any and all cost.

W. T. SHERMAN,
Major-General.
