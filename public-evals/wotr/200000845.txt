FORT SUMTER, February 6, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the 42-pounder rifle, with cracked band, was removed to the city last night by Mr. Lacoste. All quiet yesterday and last night. Weather too thick for correct observations of fleet.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
