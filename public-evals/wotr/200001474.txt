Saint Louis, June 2, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Commanding Central District, Warrensburg, Mo.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch and inclosures, explanatory of the scouting done in your district, and to say that they show commendable attention to the business. But it is evident that your scouting parties often move too openly, and approach camps and houses with too little preparation for escapes and other contingencies; in short, they do not play their game "fine enough." Give great attention to this, instructing the officers how to avoid going to houses and following escapes to occur for want of care and forethought, or of liberation in firing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BEN. M. PIATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
