Milwaukee, Wis., June 2, 1864.

Brigadier General H. H. SIBLEY,

Commanding Dist. of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minn.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that the 400 mounted men you are authorized to withhold from the expedition to join General Sully be immediately replaced by the four companies of the Thirtieth Wisconsin sent you from this point and Davenport, and you will accordingly send to General Sully the whole force originally ordered from your district. You had best use the four companies of the Thirtieth Wisconsin, or such parts of them as may be needed for that purpose, to establish the post on James River, where they will remain until relieved by the companies of the Eighth designated for its permanent garrison. As soon as you hear that the companies of the Eighth have reached the post on James River, you will direct the four companies of the Thirtieth Wisconsin to march from that post to the Missouri River, to report to Brigadier-General Sully for duty. You will be notified in time to what point on the Missouri to direct their march.

I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. MELINE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
