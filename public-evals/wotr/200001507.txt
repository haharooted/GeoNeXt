QUARTERMASTER'S DEPT., OFFICE OF TRANSPORTATION,

Saint Louis, June 1, 1864.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, DEPT. OF THE MO.,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Seventh Illinois Volunteer Cavalry leave at 6.15 p.m. this evening. I desire to express my sincerest thanks to General Rosecrans for his kindness, toward us, and feel confident that if it had been in the authority of the Department of the Missouri to mount and arm the regiment it would have dean done. As a favor I have the honor to request that Sergeant Weking, Company M, Robert Sheetz, Company H, William Martin, Company I, and perhaps one or two others may be ordered to report to regiment, on board steamer Olive Branch. They are in confinement in military prison, Saint Louis.

Respectfully,

EDWARD PRINCE,

Colonel Seventh Illinois Volunteer Cavalry.
