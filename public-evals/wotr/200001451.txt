HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO, Denver, Colo. Ter., April 16, 1864.

First Lieutenant G. L. SHOUP,

First Cavalry of Colorado, Commanding Escort to Commissary Train from Denver to Fort Union:

LIEUTENANT: The colonel commanding directs that you return with your command to Camp Fillmore without delay. You will forward by one of your men the accompanying dispatch to the commanding officer, Fort Union, N. Max., who is therein requested to send out a detachment to meet and escort the train to that post. The Indian troubles have reached a climax. On 12th instant Lieutenant Dunn, with a small party, had a fight with a band of Cheyennes near Fremont' Orchard, and had 4 men badly wounded (1 of them has since died and 2 others are expected to). A number of Indians were killed. They are stealing stock in every direction, and refusing to give it up. Carbines with ammunition are en route to Camp Fillmore.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. STILWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
