HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF UTAH, Camp Douglas, Utah, November 6, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,.

Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of the report of Major McGarry, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, detailing the result of his expedition to capture guerrillas and punish Indians engaged in the late massacres on the Humbold River, for the information of the general commanding the department. I am satisfied from verbal information received fromoffices of the expedition that the Indians who have been punished were a aprt of those who had committed the late murders, and that the punishment was well merited.

I hope and believe that the lesson taught them will have a salutary effect in checking future massacres on that route.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. EDWARD CONNOR,

Colonel Third Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding District.
