LEXINGTON, KY., June 13, 1864.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

General Burbridge send me word by couriers from Georgetown, 11. 40 a. m., to send parties toward Mount Sterling to capture straggling rebels. He authorized me to offer a reward of $1,000 to any one who shall capture Colonel D. Howard Smith. Three hundred prisoners are just coming in. If you can spare, send me two good couriers, one to Captain Hamilton, commanding the cavalry sent from here this morning, and one to your cavalry, with orders for both parties to go toward Mount Sterling, informing them of the reward offered for Colonel Smith.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
