FORT MONROE, VA., April 20, 1864. (Received 11 p. m.)

Rear-Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN,

Washington:

I have reliable information from Richmond that Colonel Dahlgren's body has been taken possession of by his Union friends, and has been put beyond the reach of the rebel authorities. I propose to take in the matter the course indicated in my last conversation with you. Please advise me if you wish any other.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
