COMMANDING OFFICER AT FORT WALLA WALLA:

We, the undersigned, citizens of Grande Ronde Valley, would respectfully petition you for the assistance of one company or more of soldiers to be stationed here. Whereas depredations have been committed here by the Indians, and that we are so scattered over the valley that we have not the measn of defense, and that our lives and property are not safe, and if you will grant our petition you will confer a great favor on the petitioners.
