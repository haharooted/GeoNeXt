HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, Memphis, Tenn., June 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General STURGIS:

Do you want any more cars sent out? Is there any truth about the enemy moving south of Collierville White's Station as you mentioned a while since? Are you perfectly safe, and do you want anything?

C. C. WASHBURN,
Major-General.
