THIBODEAUX, LA., January 23, 1864.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

Three scouting parties have returned from the lakes, &c., without developing anything of importance. I find a large number of boats on the lakes which assist the inhabitants to carry on smuggling, and could, if collected, convey a force of 300 or 400 men to within a short march of our lines on La Fourche. I deem it advisable to destroy these, leaving a sufficient number of the smaller ones for fishing purposes. The inhabitants assist the Confederates in coming over in small squads, notwithstanding pickets and scouts. I am satisfied from personal observations this would not only be just and proper,but would aid in preventing raids. If the telegraph is run up to Donaldsonsville along the bayou, it may be frequently cut, unless I hold the inhabitants responsible by ordering them to report any one tampering with it. Shall I act thus in regard to the boats and wire?

E. L. MOLINEUX,

Colonel, Commanding.
