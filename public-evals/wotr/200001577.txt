Captain W. C. RAWOLLE,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Colonel Waring has been grazing his horses about two hours. He is entirely out of ammunition, and is desirous of reaching his camp to-night. I think it advisable that he do so. Colonel Winslow is also out of ammunition, and should, I think, reach Germantown to-night.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.
