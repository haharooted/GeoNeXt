Batesville, January 30, 1864.

Captain A. B. KAUFFMAN,

Eleventh Missouri Cavalry:

CAPTAIN: Captain Dunscomb, Third Arkansas Cavalry, with 50 men, in company with Captain Castle Eleventh Missouri Cavalry, with a command of the same strength, will proceed to the mouth of Black River, Ark., at the south side of White Rive, and from thence to Grand Glaize. You will join them at that point (the Glaize), and proceeding up Glaize Creek, will attack the enemy reported to be camped about 7 miles out on the road from the Glaize to Searcy. You will be governed in a measure by the information you can gather along your route, but attack the enemy wherever they may be found. All rebels under arms who are wearing Federal uniforms will be shot. You will deal in the most summary manner with all guerrillas found on your march. Be specially careful to guard your prisoners, and in the event of your having success, send a telegram by Captain Dunscomb to Little Rock, to be forwarded to Colonel O. D. Greene, assistant adjutant-general, Department of the Missouri, giving the results and retain a copy of the same. As soon as this is done return with all possible dispatch to this station.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. R. LIVINGSTON,

Colonel First Nebraska Cavalry, Commanding District.
