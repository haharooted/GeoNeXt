HEADQUARTERS,
Fort Crook, October 26, 1862.

COLONEL: On the evening of the 21st instant information was brought me that a train had been attacked by Indians on the Yreka road about thirty miles from the post. I immediately sent out Lieutenant Williams with twelve men to render any assistance required. He returned on the 26th instant, after seeing them over the mountains, and reported that the emigrants had succeeded in driving off the Indians, killing one, and losing nothing but their provisions which was stolen while they were hunting cattle. On the night of the 23rd instant I left the post with sixteen men to try and punish the Hot Creek Indians, who had been driving off cattle. I arrived at their camp about daylight and found that the majority were absent. Two bucks were shot. The tribe has been uneasy of late, and seemed disposed to commence operations. I shall watch them closely, and if possible try to punish them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY B. MELLEN.

Captain, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding.

Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, San Francisco.
