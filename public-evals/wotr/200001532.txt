FORT SUMTER, January 31, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that there was no firing last night; it was resumed this morning as usual. A heavy cargo of sand and lumber was discharged last night. A 42-pounder was placed in the northwest caseate ready to be mounted; a second, with cracked band, is half way up the slope and will be on the berm today for shipment to-morrow night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
