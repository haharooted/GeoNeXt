HEADQUARTERS,
Judd's Valley, September 28, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: In accordance with instructions I left Camp Drum on the 18th instant with Companies C and E, Second Cavalry California Volunteers. I have examined the country around Battle, Antelope, Deer, and Mill Creeks. From information received at Red Bluff I supposed that the Indians would be among the canons of the above-named creeks, but within a circuit of about twenty miles found no signs, except what were about three weeks old. Not considering that any good can be accomplished by remaining, I have directed Lieutenant Berry to send a detachment from his company to scout among the foothills in the direction of Chico, and if nothing can be discovered to return to the Bluff and report for orders. Information reached me yesterday that a settler living in Mountain Meadows had been killed by the Indians. I shall proceed with Company C in that direction and inquire into the matter, and after ecamining the country in that region shall go to Fort Crook by that route. I believe that the Indians who have been committing depredations in Tehama Country are roving bands, who make their raids and immediately retreat to the mountains, assisted in every way by those who are in a measure domesticated at the different ranches along the Sacrament River. And it is the opinio of every settler with whom I have talked that, so long as they are allowed to remain, there will be trouble. Some believe that the pet Indians are the ones who commit all the depredations, leaving the ranches for a foray, and as soon as any expeditions are sent out quietly return to their homes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY B. MELLEN,

Captain, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding.
