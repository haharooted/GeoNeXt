CHARLESTON, February 9, 1864-11.16 a. m.

Have already sent General Finegan, from Savannah, two regiments infantry and one light battery, all I can spare. Am sending Colquitt's brigade form here to Savannah to replace them, and supply place of Georgia State troops lately discharged. Can't a brigade be sent to Florida temporarily form some other department? Our supplies in that State are becoming indispensable. I suppose enemy's movement is a feint to draw troops from South Carolina and Georgia.
