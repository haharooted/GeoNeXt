HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, Cal., October 6, 1862.

Colonel FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,

Second Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding District of Humboldt, Fort Humboldt, Cal.:

SIR: The department commander desires you to reduce the garrison of Fort Gaston by one company, believing the remaining force (two companies) sufficient for the protection of that point. While affording the greatest possible protection to the various settlements, you will have the least number of posts practicable for permanent locations. All small detachments should be withdrawn and the troops concentrated at the points suitable to commence a vigorous winter campaign.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
