Numbers 3. Report of Major General Samuel Jones, C. S. Army, commanding Department of Western Virginia.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,
Dublin, February 15, 1864.

GENERAL: I inclose with this a copy of a letter received this morning from Major Nounnan, of the Sixteenth Regiment Virginia Cavalry, together with a parole* signed by 23 enlisted men of the U. S. Army. Lieutenant Vertegans, of the same regiment, of whom the major speaks in complimentary terms, will start to-morrow for Richmond with Brigadier-General Scammon and the 2 officers of his staff- Lieutenants Pinckard and Millward. Major Nounnan and his small party, especially Lieutenant Vertegans, have performed their duty in the most creditable manner.

I sent Colonel Ferguson with his regiment (the Sixteenth Virginia Cavalry) to the Lower Kanawha late in December last. He has so far conducted the expedition with judgment and discretion; has captured much of the enemy's property and a number of prisoners, and diverted the attention of the enemy in that quarter from this part of the country to the protection of their own border.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
