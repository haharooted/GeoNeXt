CAMP INDEPENDENCE, OWEN'S RIVER VALLEY,

September 26, 1862.

[HENRY D.] BARROWS,

U. S. Marshal, Southern District of California, Los Angeles, Cal.:

SIR: By direction from headquarters Department of the Pacific I shall proceed hence to Visalia with a portion of my command, there to spend the winter. I have been further directed to communicate with you in regard to a deputy U. S. marshal for the Southern District of California being appointed by you to reside at Visalia or near my camp. As my duty in Tulare County will be mostly to look out for secesh and to enforce the proclamation of the President in regard to the arrest of traitors, you will see the necessity of a deputy U. S. marshal for the Southern District of California being appointed immediately, to reside in the vicinity of Visalia. I would most respectfully suggest that unless you are acquainted personally with some good, sound Union man in that vicinity to appoint, that in order to save time and bring things straight amongst the traitors of Tulare and surrounding country, you had better send a blank commission to me immediately, with directions as to the amount of bond required, &c., and I will see that it is filled up with the name of some proper person, and that the bond is uly filed, &c.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. EVANS,

Lieutenant-Colonel Second Cavalry California Volunteers.
