HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 29, 1864.

Brigadier-General HOLLAND,

Commanding in the Field:

The object of Colonel Hughes in falling back might have been to intercept Company H of the Eighth Missouri State Militia, moving across Rolling Prairie to join Captain Human's battalion. This company should have crossed Rolling Prairie as early as last Tuesday. I think it important that the forces from Berryville should make a demonstration on the enemy as speedily as possible. You will, however, act from your better knowledge of the condition of things.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain Cameron, commanding at Cassville, Mo., will forward this dispatch to General Holland at Berryville.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
