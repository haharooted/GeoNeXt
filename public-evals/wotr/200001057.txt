Colonel C. S. HANSON,
Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that your force swing around in the direction of WEST Liberty; that you spare neither men, money, nor horses in capturing rebels. Separate your command, if necessary, and pursue small squads with equal numbers. Take fresh horses wherever found, when necessary, and live on the country. Spare no efforts to prevent a rebel leaving the State.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
