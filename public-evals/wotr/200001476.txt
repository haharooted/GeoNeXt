SPRINGFIELD, MO., May 21, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

There are quite a number of rebel troops north of the Arkansas River, and they are constantly moving north in bodies of from 50 to 125. It seems utterly impossible with my reduced stock to intercept them or bring them to an engagement.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General..

Major-General.
