TUNNEL HILL, May 10, 1864.

Major-General HOOKER:

The major-general commanding wishes you to send a staff officer to see that a brigade of William's division is posted on the top of the mountain to the east of Snake Creek Gap, so as to hold possession of the mountain and prevent the enemy marching south along its crest to take General McPherson's left flank or rear. Have this done at once, if not already done.

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The position of the brigade should be about where the letter "O," [in the word] mountain, is on the mp.

S. HOFFMAN.
