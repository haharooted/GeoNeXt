[Third indorsement.]

JUNE 16, 1864.

Respectfully referred back to Brigadier-General Birney, for information as to be protection he can give the line if built.

If the General Birney is satisfied upon this point, the material, &c., will be furnished by Captain Sheldon from these headquarters. The line, however, cannot be erected until operators can be obtained to work it.
