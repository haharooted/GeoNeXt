SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 31, 1864

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Warrensburg, Mo.:

Our present information is not of a character to warrant calling out the militia of your district, involving, as it would, much expense and individual loss. Every precautionary step possible must be quietly taken. Are your wagons and teams in good order and at hand?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
