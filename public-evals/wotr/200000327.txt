Springfield, Mo., January 24, 1864

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of the Missouri:

Colonel Crandall, who has all winter been operating in Northern Arkansas along the White River, is reported as having abandoned the Confederate cause and gone to Memphis. I am confident he has gone, and I think it would be well to call the attention of the commander of the post of Memphis to this important intelligence. He is more likely to have gone there and not abandoned the cause. I have no news from the troops operating in Arkansas. From this I infer that Mayes, Gunning, and Freeman have fallen back.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
