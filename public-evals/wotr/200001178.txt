HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,
Mesilla, October 12, 1862.

Lieutenant BEN. C. CUTLER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Santa Fe:

I respectfully ask permission to return the within copy of a letter from Major Fergusson, commanding Tucson, to the Governor of Sonora, suggesting the establishment of a passport system between our lines and the neighboring territory of Mexico. * In my opinion such a system would be totally ineffectual, owing to the extent of a frontier line that is altogether without prohibition of free passage either way. An individual desiring to avoid the necessity of a passport can choose his own point for crossing the line, and can tell his own story whenever questioned as to where he comes from. When there are troops in the district no man goes to and fro without the cognizance of the officer in command. That is all I can presume to control without a certainty of failure.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
