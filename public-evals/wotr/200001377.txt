REMARKS.

After traveling a mile we descended the bluff and entered a portion of the Great Black River Swamp; land low and very marshy, covered with dense forest and canebrake; bridge over creeks. Found camp of enemy on opposite side of river. No means of crossing for an attack; ice quite rotten, channel open. Found 21 head of cattle; drove our and camped. Next day returned. Rained all forenoon; snowed till night.

The land for several miles is very good, the best tract of land I have seen in the State; good farms, good timber and soil; well adapted to the growth of corn and cotton. The road crosses the old military road at the Walnut Church, where the rebels shot some of our prisoners. Camped at Harrison's Mill; mill, cotton-gin, and press all together; good farm; people nearly all Union.
