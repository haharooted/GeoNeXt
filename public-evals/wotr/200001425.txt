SAINT LOUIS, April 17, 1864-11 a. m. (Received 12.25 p. m., 18th.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

By having authority to use the dismounted cavalry at depot for guard at Saint Louis, and Ninth Iowa Cavalry ordered to Littler Rock can sent two regiments of infantry and one of cavalry, and Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry, Colonel Beveridge, now at Saint Charles, Ill., for which I am an applicant. The rebels wish to stop and prevent planting in West Kentucky and Tennessee. The intention of the rebels in Northern Arkansas, and of the guerrillas, with a powerful armed secret organization here, is to do the same in Missouri, and the time of the advent of their operations is at hand, for which reason no move of troops from the interior to increase the feelings of insecurity here should, if possible, be made until planting is over. Please, if you approve, send orders at once about using the Ninth Iowa and Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry,and as to the dismounted cavalry form the depot.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
