PILOT KNOB, April 11, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding District of Saint Louis:

Some more of those most notorious bandits and guerrillas I got track of crossed the river into Illinois. May I send after them? To catch the leaders and to catch these robbers at their haunt will do more good than to send whole companies after them when they have once come over the river.

JOHN N. HERDER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
