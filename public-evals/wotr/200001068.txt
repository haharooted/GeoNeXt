COLLIERVILLE, June 12, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

Have just received your telegram. The enemy pursued us with great vigor to this place, but, so far as I know, with cavalry alone. Our ammunition being almost exhausted, but few troops having any, he was enabled to inflict serious injury by his repeated attacks on my rear. I think the force you are now sending will suffice, as it is not possible for the enemy to send a large infantry force to this place over so destitute a country as we have just been over and in the present condition of the roads. Had our ammunition not been exhausted our loss would not have been so severe, except in material of war, and that could not be avoided in the present, execrable condition of the roads. We lost no artillery in battle, and yet were compelled to spike and destroy nearly all we had because it was impossible to drag it through the mud with animals so wasted in strength through want of forage.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
