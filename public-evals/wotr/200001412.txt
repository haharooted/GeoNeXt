HARRISONVILLE, MO., April 16, 1864.

Colonel JAMES H. FORD,

Commanding Fourth Sub-District, Kansas City, Mo.:

SIR: I arrived here this morning from off Grand River to get some horses shod. I scouted on the Missouri River two days and found no sign of bushwhackers or boats. We looked at every foot of the river bank from the month of Little Blue to La Fayette line. We then went south on the west line of this district to Grand River, then up both sides of the Grand to Dayton, where we struck the trail of some Company L men, who were stationed at Dayton. We leave this day at noon for Grand River, taking a southwest course through Grand and its branches. Our horses are getting pretty thin, and will need some time to recruit when we get in. I hear of 2 men that were sent up to you. I hope you will keep them for us to escort to Warrensburg or somewhere else. I am happy to inform you that we have not come onto a bushwhacker trail since we started, nor heard of one, and we have scoured the country where we went well. Have followed up many trails, but they come out all right when followed up.

Trusting the above will meet with your approbation, I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. ALLEN,

Commanding Scouts.
