HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,
Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., October 2, 1862.

ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: I have to-day received the Special Orders, Numbers 168, of the 23rd ultimo, from department headquarters, ordering Captain Crowninshield's company of Fourth California Volunteer Infantry to San Francisco. I desire again respectfully to request, as I did on the 19th of July, that the general commanding will not direct that any more companies of California volunteers be removed from this district. There are now but sixteen companies in it. Two companies of the Fourth California Volunteers remain, viz, Captain Fitch's, at Fort Dalles, and Captain Scott's, at Fort yamhill. If anything in the internal condition or demoralization of Company E, at Fort Steilacoom, renders its removal advisable, I desire to say that I know of nothing of the kind in reference to the other two companies. The frontiers of this district are nearly as extensive as California, with a much smaller population; therefore it would not of place for California volunteers to remain in Oregon. On the 17th ultimo, as shown in my Special Orders, Numbers 67, of that date, forwarded to you, the organization of Captain W. V. Spencer's company (F), First Washington Territory Volunteer Infantry, was completed and it was mustered into the service. But little progress (twenty-seven recruits last date) is made with the company attempted to be raised at Olympia, and the last tri-monthly report from Fort Walla Walla does not report any raised there, as it was proposed.

I have the honor to be, very resptectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.

P. S. - In a few days I shall send a detailed report on Indian affairs, showing that on account of the occupation by the whites of that country the establishment of a post near Fort Boise next spring will be desirable.
