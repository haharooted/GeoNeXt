LEXINGTON, June 14, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

Your dispatch in regard to ex-Colonel Wolford was received during my absence in pursuit of Morgan, and will be attended to immediately. In six days my command has marched over 200 miles, fought two severe battles, killing, wounding, and capturing over three-fourths of Morgan's command. The remaining fourth is scattered and being pursued in all directions.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brigadier-General.
