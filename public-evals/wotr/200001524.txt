CHARLESTON, June 15, 1864.

The movements of the enemy decidedly indicate an attach on some point near here. Troops are concentrating on Folly Island. My force is not only entirely too small for the protection of Charleston and Savannah and the railroad connecting them, but some of the troops cannot be relied on. A part of a guard near Savannah over powered the others yesterday and escaped to Fort Pulaski. Many men of the First South Carolina regiment artillery and Lucas' battalion firmly believe that they are held in service illegally and are greatly dissatisfied, and desertions to the enemy are frequent. General McLaws considers the whole garrison of Fort Bartow unsound. I cannot place reliance in them. I beg that 2,00 infantry be sent me for service here and 1,000 for service at Savannah. With that additional force I believe I can hold the places against the force in my front. If not re-enforced serious disaster may soon occur. I have received no reserve force . Please bring this to the attention of the President and reply.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER.
