LEXINGTON, June 13, 1864-7 p. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Camp Nelson, Ky.:

General Burbridge has arrived here. Rebel loss at Cynthiana, 300 killed and 400 prisoners, besides wounded. Morgan's force is scattered, out of ammunition, totally demoralized. Colonel Weatherford reached Danville, and, I learn has left in pursuit of the rebels who started for Stanford and Crab Orchard from Lancaster. Don't order our men toward Mount Sterling. If you send courier, order them in hot pursuit south.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
