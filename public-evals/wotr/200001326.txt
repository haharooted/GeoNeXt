HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,
In the Field, May 10, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

How do you like the idea of leaving General Schofield where he is, placing General Howard in front of the gap, to intrench himself to hold the gap; Palmer's corps in reserve, with ten days' provisions and full supply of ammunition, to re-enforce General McPherson, if necessary; and send General Hooker's corps at once to support. General McPherson? I make this proposition simply because I think General Hooker's corps will be sufficient to enable General McPherson to whip any force that Johnston can bring against him. Not knowing what your plans may be, I submit this for your consideration.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS.
