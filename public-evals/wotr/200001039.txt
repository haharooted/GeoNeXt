LOUISVILLE, KY., June 13, 1864.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Please ask War Department if they know where General Buckner is. There has been no recent public statement of his whereabouts. Rebels here privately claim that he will enter the State with a large force. The perfect indifference to local defenses, and sullen temper exhibited here, are unmistakable. I wish to omit to precaution.

HENRY B. CARRINGTON,

Brigadier-General.
