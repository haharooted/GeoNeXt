CHARLESTON, S. C., May 4, 1864.

Two regiments of Wise's brigade have started for Richmond; the remainder will leave to-morrow. Colquitt's brigade will follow without delay. None of the troops ordered to me from General Johnson's army have arrived. I have only two regiments and one weak battalion, including Colonel Keitt's, on Sullivan's Island. No infantry on James Island, but one regiment of infantry between here and Savannah;there one regiment and two battalions, thirteen companies of department. The two cavalry regiments ordered from Virginia are not yet for duty. I will make the best arrangements possible under the circumstances, but if it be possible send me a few more regiments.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
