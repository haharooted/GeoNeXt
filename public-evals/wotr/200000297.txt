FRANKLIN, LA., January 26, 1864.

(Received 7 p. m.)

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

I think it may be important to state that the communication received by me to-day from Major Levy is dated headquarters C. S. Forces in Western Louisiana, New Iberia, January 25, from which it would appear that General Taylor's headquarters have been within a few days removed from Alexandria to New Iberia.

CHAS. C. DWIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding, &c.
