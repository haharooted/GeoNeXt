HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON.

Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., August 26, 1862

SIR: I herewith transmit for the information of the general commanding the department a copy of the report, dated 23rd instant, of Captain G. B. Currey, of Company E, First Cavalry Oregon Volunteers, of his recent expedition to the Grande Ronde Valley; a copy of Colonel J. Steinberger's instructions to him, dated the 9th instant; a copy of Colonel Steinberger's dispatch of the 23rd instant, and a copy of my instructions of the 20th instant, on the general subject of aiding Indian Department in requiring the Indians to live on the Indian reservation. You will perceive that the expedition was entirely successful. It resulted in the death of four death of four Indians, including the leader, Tenounis, or Big Talk on Four Mountains, otherwise called the Dreamer, whose ominous prophesies had exerted a baneful influence over the small party who followed his fortunes. The killing of these appears to have been a necessary and unavoidable act. I have no doubt that the effect of the movement will be to prevent any further aggression aginst the whites at the Grand Ronde Valley, adn will have a salutary effect on all the surrounding tribes. The great majority of the Indians on the Umatilla Reservation appear to have had no sympathy with the Dreamer or his assumptions. A report from Lieutenant-Colonel Maury, dated 17th instant, shows that his expedition had reached the Owyhee River. He had met thus far 300 wagons of emigrants. Few Indian disturbances or depredations had occurred. The emigrants express much satisfaction in the movements of troops, which have every likelihood of preventing collisions.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL.

Headquarters Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.
