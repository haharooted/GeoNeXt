FORT CHURCHILL, September 15, 1862 - 11. 30 a. m.

General WRIGHT:

Indians at Gravelly Ford, 200 miles from this post, on Humboldt River, have murderd twenty-three emigrants. Residents of Lower Humboldt ask for assistance. Distance from this post too great to render required protection. Gravelly Ford seventy-five miles from Ruby Valley. I have dispatched above to Colonel Connor.
