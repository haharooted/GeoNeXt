V. Due vigilance will be exercised to guard against surprise, and all troops must be kept prepared to meet the enemy promptly. Commanding officers must see that their commands are in readiness to take the field at a moment's warning.

VI. The undersigned deems this a proper occasion to warmly commend the very excellent conduct of the troops stationed on the Rio Grande within this district. He feels and knows that by their patient discipline, exemplary private conduct, and the zeal manifested to perfect themselves as accomplished soldiers they are qualifying themselves for more important services and earning the right to be advanced nearer to the heart of the rebellion. And to still further improvement let the efforts of every officer and soldier in the district tend.

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
