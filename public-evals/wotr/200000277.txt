HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE BORDER,
Kansas City, Mo., January 24, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS:

GENERAL: If I am to command the District of the Border, please do not fix headquarters until I see you. I am decidedly of the opinion that there will be a revival of guerrilla warfare along that part of the border north of the Osage, requiring very close and careful attention on the part of the district commander, and requiring the service of a large portion of the troops of the district. If that anticipation is verified, Fort Scott will be too far south of the infested district for district headquarters, as Fort Leavenworth is too far north of it. I expect to be relieved here within a week.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
