IN THE FIELD, NEAR HARRISONBURG, LA.,

March 5, 1864.

SIR: I beg leave to state that Lieutenant O. Gaudet, commanding the howitzer section of this battery, recently detached with the infantry sent to Trinity, has reported to me that on the night march from that place he was ordered by Colonel Speight, of the [Fifteenth] Regiment Texas Infantry, who commanded the rear guard, to abandon his two caissons in order to save his pieces, the caissons being left 6 miles below this place on the road to Trinity without a guard to protect this valuable property; also, that when he arrived at the ferry on Bushly Bayou, just below Harrisonburg, he was not allowed to cross his pieces, horses, or men until all of the infantry and their wagons, including the rear guard of infantry, had been ferried over.

I beg leave most respectfully to protest against, this very unusual and irregular proceeding, which I believe was done without your knowledge or consent. As a rule, under such circumstance artillery is crossed early and placed in position on the opposite bank to cover the crossing of troops and trains. This, sir, is written in no spirit of fault-finding, but only to call attention to a very unusual and unmilitary occurrence.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. A. FARIES,

Captain, Commanding Battery.

Brigadier General C. J. POLIGNAC,

Commanding Second Brigade Infantry.
