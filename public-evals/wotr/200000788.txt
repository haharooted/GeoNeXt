HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,
Vicksburg, Miss., May 30, 1864.

Captain JOHN M. WILSON,

Corps of Engineers, A. I. G., Mil. Div. of West Miss.:

SIR: The commanding general directs that your office be established in this city until after you have completed the transfer of the duties upon which you have recently been engaged, visiting Memphis and any other point at which you may have unfinished business. Until an officer has been designated to take charge of the office in this city, you will also receive and take charge of any business in relation to the Division of West Mississippi that may be sent to that office.

He desire that you will immediately call upon the inspectors in the Departments of Arkansas and the Gulf, and at the posts on the Mississippi River, embraced in the operation of War Department Special Orders, Numbers 171, of the 7th instant, for such reports as may be necessary to exhibit the present actual condition of the troops in this command. In order to gain time these calls will be made direct, but duplicates of your instructions will be sent to the commander on whose staff the inspector is serving. The special objects to which your attention will be directed are the organization equipment, and efficiency of the cavalry and artillery forces, the state and efficiency of the departments of supply, and the transport service on land and water. Special inspections of such branches of the service as may appear to require it will be made by officers selected for that purpose.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN F. S. GRAY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
