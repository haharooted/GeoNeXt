HEADQUARTERS,
In the Field, May 10, 1864-2 p. m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Your communication of this morning just received. It seems to me that your first plan of proposed operations is the best; but, inasmuch as Johnston will be compelled to hold a large part of his force in Buzzard Roost Gap as long as it is threatened, Hooker's corp might be sent at once to re-enforce General McPherson, whilst General Palmer's corps could be placed in reserve, to march at a moment's notice, and Howard's Corps placed in position to defend the gap and hold the enemy in check. In the mean time the depot could be withdrawn to Ringgold, and to-morrow night General Schofield's command take position in front of Ringgold and in the gap, with General Stoneman's cavalry covering its front, whilst Palmer's and Howard's corps could march as you suggest by the main Mill Creek road to Villanow, sending their wagons by the Trickum road, covering their movement with McCook's cavalry, which can afterward occupy Villanow and Ship's Gap, and securing our communications with Ringgold.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS.
