Saint Louis, Mo., June 3, 1864.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

In my dispatch to General Halleck I represented the necessity of having other troops here than the militia, for prison guards. From their composition, it is impossible to guard the prisons with safety. Can I have the Veteran Reserves asked for? Must have something.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
