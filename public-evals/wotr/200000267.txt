SPRINGFIELD, MO., January 26, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have received a dispatch, dated at Berryville yesterday morning, from Captain Duff, in command there, stating that there was a force of 500 rebels within 15 miles, intending to attack that place. This force must have eluded our force in Arkansas and come to the rear. I have sent forward 250 men and one section of artillery to Cassville, with instructions for it to go forward to Berryville if weather remains in same state. I shall leave for Cassville to-day if the roads do change. A scout bearing dispatches to Captain Human was attacked on Rolling Prairie, and 19 are missing.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General.
