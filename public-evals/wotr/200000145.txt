General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,
Morton's Ford, February 6, 1864-2. 15 p. m.

GENERAL: I sent a staff officer to General Newton, to inform him that I had crossed a division and to learn his movements. He informs me that General Newton is putting his men in position 1 1/2 miles from Raccoon Ford, and that he has made no further demonstration and did not intend attempting to ford until he had more accurate information of the force in his front. The enemy is rapidly re-enforcing his line in my front. I have now a division across the river about half a mile from the ford. The ford is very difficult. If it rains it will be necessary either to lay a bridge or to withdraw my troops this side the river. I respectfully ask instructions how to proceed. I have heard no firing except in my front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. CALDWELL,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
