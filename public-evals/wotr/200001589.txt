HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, September 22, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of a communication from Colonel P. E. Connor, Third Infantry California Volunteers, commanding the District of Utah, dated at Fort Ruby, Ruby Valley, September 14, 1862. * Colonel Connor is now on his march to Salt Lake, and I have instructed him to take up his position at the place he suggests, three miles from the city, as that appears to be the best location for the accomplishment of the object in view, viz, the protection of the Overland Mail Route and the due execution of the laws of the United States. The energy of Colonel Connor, coupled with his soud judgment and decision of character, point him out as eminetly fitted for the command with which I have intrusted him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
