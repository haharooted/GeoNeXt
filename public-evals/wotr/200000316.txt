HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE KANSAS,
Fort Leavernworth, January 29, 1864.

Brigadier General THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Kansas City, Mo.:

GENERAL: I hope you will continue to act, if occasion requires, on either side of the line, till you are relieved, according to your orders. Suppose the Kansas troops on the Missouri side cannot leave and must be controlled by you. I expect to make a hasty visit to the southern part of the State before determining as to new arrangements.

Very truly, yours,

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
