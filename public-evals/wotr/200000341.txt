GENERAL ORDERS,
 HDQRS. 1ST Brigadier, ARMY OF THE FRONTIER, Numbers 3. In the Field, January 31, 1864.

I. Every regiment and company in the command while on the march will call roll at least three times each day, even while temporarily halting, and whenever the command halts and is called out to march. All straggling is forbidden.

II. No stock of any kind shall be killed without orders. Any soldiers presuming, without orders from his commanding officer, to kill hogs or cattle will be tried promptly by a field officer and fined it value, at least, on his pay account. All stock required shall be killed under order and properly accounted for, and any commanding officer who may find it necessary to kill beef or pork will do so under proper regulations, issuing what is right and accounting for it correctly to the proper disbursing officer at Fort Gibson. His failure to do so will render him personally liable for the amount taken without compliance with this order.

III. There shall be no stock taken without orders, and all taken shall be immediately reported and the parties ordering it taken held accountable for its being put regularly in the hands of the proper officer.

IV. No picket or other guard, while the command is on the march, shall make fire without permission.

V. All officers knowing to the fact of any man of their command leaving the command, or deserting their comrades whilst on the march before the enemy, will make it their special duty to prefer charges against them and see that they are arrested, to the end that they be shot as deserters.

VI. These orders and the printed circular issued shall be read every day while the command is on the march. This order shall be interpreted to the men each day.

By order of Colonel William A. Phillips, commanding:

WM. GALLAHER,

First Lieutenant, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
