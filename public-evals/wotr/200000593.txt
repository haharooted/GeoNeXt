HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,
Saint Joseph, Mo., June 2, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

Is Colonel Chipman with General Canby? If so, where can I address him? My forces are pursuing a band of bushwhackers through Platte County; they number about 25 and may get across the river into Kansas. I know they will be properly received by your command. Have you any news from the southern border?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
