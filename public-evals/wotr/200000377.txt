PATTERSON, MO., January 18, 1864

General FISK:

My scouts came in this evening from near Doniphan. They could hear of nothing. All quiet in that quarter. I have scouts between Poplar Bluff and Bloomfield. I also have a scout in the vicinity of Barnesville, Reynolds County. I have nothing new from Batesville.

W. T. LEEPER,

Captain, Commanding Post.
