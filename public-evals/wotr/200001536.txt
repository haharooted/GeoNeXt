HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH,
Folly Island, S. C., June 7, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM HEINE,

Commanding, Folly Island:

COLONEL: The general commanding district directs that you have a few shots fired each day, until further orders, from 30-pounder Parrott guns on Cole's Island, to the rebel lookout at Legareville. These shots will be at irregular intervals and such arrangements will be made as will prevent the enemy from making any calculations as to when they will be fired, or from receiving any warning to enable them to get out of the way of the shots. You will give proper notice of this order to the gun-boats in Stono River.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. DEAN,

Lieutenant, 127th New York Vols., and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
