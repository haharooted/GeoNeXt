Colonel W. R. JUDSON,

Commanding District of Frontier, Fort Smith:

I cannot spare any troops from this district at present. I am still holding the Yellville Rolling Prairie region in Arkansas, and I will move some troops along toward Huntsville in a few days, two or three days, and assist you all that I can. My command has killed and captured about 100 in Arkansas within the past twelve days.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
