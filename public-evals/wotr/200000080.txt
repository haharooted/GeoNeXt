Tunnel Hill, May 10, 1864.

Major General J. M. PALMER,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your note received. The major-general commanding directs that breast-works of logs and material which can be easily got together be thrown up on our advanced skirmish line with perhaps the same for the first supporting brigade, to render their position more secure. None to be thrown up on the ridge in rear of your troops.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,
