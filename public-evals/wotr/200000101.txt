HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 1, 1864-10 p. m. (Received 11. 30 p. m.)

No intelligence has been received from Kilpatrick's command since yesterday at 2 a. m., at which time he was passing through Spotsylvania Court-House, having captured the picket at Ely's Ford on the Rappahannock, consisting of 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, and 15 men. In order to make a diversion in his favor the Sixth Corps. General Sedgwick, moved from its camp on the 27th and occupied Madison Court-House. On the 28th, Brigadier-General Custer, in command of a cavalry force and a section of artillery, left Madison Court-House with instructions to attempt the destruction of the Lynchburg Railroad bridge over the Rivanna, near Charlottesville. General Custer reached the bridge, but found it strongly guarded by infantry, cavalry, and artillery. He, however, destroyed another bridge over the Rivanna, within 2 miles of the railroad, drove the enemy from a large camp, destroyed 6 caissons with ammunition, 2 forges with harness, burnt 3 large flouring mills filled with grain took 1 standard bearing the Virginia State arms, seized 500 horses and 2 Government wagons loaded with bacon, and on his return cut his way through a large force of cavalry and artillery under Generals Stuart and Wickham, with slight loss to himself, inflicting severe loss on the enemy, and bringing back 50 prisoners, returning to Madison Court-House at 6 p. m. this day, having accomplished since his departure therefrom a march of over 100 miles. The force at Madison will be withdrawn to-morrow.
