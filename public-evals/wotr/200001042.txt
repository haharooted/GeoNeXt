WHITE'S STATION, June 13, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

A train is now out, and one regiment infantry and 700 cavalry to protect it. The last news was to the effect they were in line of battle, and nothing heard from them since the arrival of last train 4 o'clock. I fear the enemy may have destroyed a culvert or done injury to the road, or the train would have been in by this time. I am just sending all the available force here toward Germantown to be ready in case they are needed.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
