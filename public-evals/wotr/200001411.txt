I have stopped here parts of three companies First Indiana Artillery, which had orders from Colonel Keith to proceed to regimental headquarters, New Orleans. But this is now the regimental headquarters. Colonel Keith is expected very soon with 300 men or more. I shall stop them unless otherwise ordered. The may be soon called upon to do service here.
