Saint Paul, Minn., January 17, 1864.

Mr. A. FARIBAULT:

DEAR SIR: From recent information at these headquarters received it appears that Tah-naf-soo-o-tah and Wah-she-chou-wilkou-e-i-dan, two of the lower Sioux who were principally engaged in the massacres of 1862, were about Faribault for some months during the last summer and fall. If so, Taopee and other of the friendly Indians must have known of their presence, and should have given the necessary information to the military authorities, that they might be apprehended. I will be obliged to you if you will make diligent inquiry into the facts of the case as it is requisite I should know if any of the Indians supposed to be friendly, and enjoying the protection of the whites at or near Faribault have so far forgotten their obligations of good faith as to conceal hostile and criminal Indians who have ventured to appear among them. A prompt investigation and reply will be thankfully acknowledged.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. SIBLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
