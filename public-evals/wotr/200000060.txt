HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,
May 10, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Admire your promptness. I have ordered Hooker to march, and it will take all to-morrow to make the move, and I will give you timely notice. I want to be certain that Stoneman is up and to know the position of your rear regiments. Are all up? Notify me also when Stoneman is at Varnell's. I am mistrustful of cavalry; it moves so slow. The foliage and absence of dust will enable us to make changes unobserved.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
