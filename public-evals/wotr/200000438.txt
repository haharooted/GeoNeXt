CLARKSVILLE, April 9, 1864.

Captain E. D. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Is it the design of your communication of the 30th, directed to me, to revoke the following telegram?

LITTLE ROCK, March 15, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel G. M. WAUGH,

Commanding:

The major-general directs that you make the country infested with guerrillas and those who are aiding them uninhabitable as soon as practicable.

Respectfully,

W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

My men are in no manner guilty of indiscriminate pillage. They only act under my orders. I now respectfully ask the names of such persons as make these accusations.

Respectfully,

G. M. WAUGH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
