CHARLESTON, S. C., May 16, 1864.

Your dispatch of to-day received. I have ordered General Anderson to form the whole of this infantry into one brigade, and send it to Richmond with the greatest possible dispatch, Brigadier-General Finegan commanding. The brigades will be small, and formed of battalions and unattached companies, but it is all I have in that State. I greatly doubt if one-half of the men ordered will leave Florida. The order will cause desertions and disorganization. I have not an infantry brigade in this department.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.
