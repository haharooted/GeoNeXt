BENTON BARRACKS, April 15, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding District of Saint Louis:

Colonel Wells, Twelfth Missouri Cavalry, to whose regiment the picket at Lowell belongs, thinks there is a disposition on the part of outside troops to threaten the guard stationed there. He thinks it advisable for me to add one squadron to that picket, which I have done, now requesting your approval.

B. L. E. BONNEVILLE,

Colonel, Commanding.
