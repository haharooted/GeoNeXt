HDQRS. DIST. OF MINNESOTA, DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,
Saint Paul, Minn., January 18, 1864

Colonel WILLIAM CROOKS,

Commanding Second Sub-District, Saint Peter;

COLONEL: In view of the possibility that some of the unmounted companies of the Second Regiment Minnesota Volunteers may be stationed at points within your sub-district, General Sibley directs that you cause the requisite inquiries to be made and information conveyed to these headquarters, first, whether quarters can be furnished ready prepared for one company each at Traverse des Sioux, Kasota, Mankato, and New Ulm; second, the actual expense per month for such quarters at each place. Although it is not absolutely determined to station troops at any of the points specified, much will depend upon the facilities afforded and the economy attendant upon such a movement at any or all of them.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. OLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
