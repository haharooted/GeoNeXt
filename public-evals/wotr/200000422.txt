[Inclosure.]

MILWAUKEE, WIS., April 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General SIBLEY,

Saint Paul, Minn.:

You misinterpret my dispatch of the 4th. The Sixth Regiment will not leave Minnesota at all until return of Eighth Regiment from expedition, but is to be used precisely as if no orders on the subject of the regiment had ever been issued. It was useless to notify the companies about being in readiness to march.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.
