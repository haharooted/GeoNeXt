FORT SUMTER, March 22, 1864.

I have the honor to report the fleet in the same position, the weather having caused no change. A forage party is to be seen this morning at the Swamp Angel. Captain Parker, with 61 men of First Regiment South Carolina Artillery, was relieved last night by Captain Mitchel, with 50 men of the same regiment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
