BATON ROUGE, LA., April 14, 1864.

Major JOHN LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General, New Orleans, La.:

I have just received a statement that Powers, with a 2,000 volunteer party, was to assault Port Hudson this morning or to-morrow. Steamer Grey Eagle passed Port Hudson this morning; reported a battle or skirmish going on, and that there was no one to receive her mail.
