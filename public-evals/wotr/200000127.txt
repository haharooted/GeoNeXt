General KELLEY:

The Levi was captured this morning at 5 o'clock at the Red House Landing, when all were sleeping on board. To-night I send, under Colonel Hayes, 100 men and two mountain howitzers, on steamer Victress, to proceed as far as possible on the river, as I do not think they have yet recrossed the Guayndotte River. If they have not I will certainly recapture General Scammon. If I do not succeed by this way my cavalry will recapture him if my orders are fully carried out. The officer at Hurricane bridge, who has allowed the enemy to cross the Hurricane Creek, is placed in arrest. I shall again call your attention to my request that a gun-boat should be sent here to protect the river.

A. N. DUFFIE,

Brigadier-General.
