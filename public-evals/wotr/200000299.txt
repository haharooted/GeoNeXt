The general commanding directs that your order all escorts going to Cassville (not to any point beyond that place) to remain at that post subject to the orders of the commanding officer of the post until further orders, and not to return to Sprinfield until ordered from these headquarters. This measure is taken to aid the troops at Cassville in performing the duties, escorts, &c., of that post, while the main force of the Second Arkansas Cavalry is in the field.

Very respectfully, &c.
