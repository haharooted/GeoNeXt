CHARLESTON, S. C., July 11, 1864.

The enemy in barges attacked Battery Simkins, near Fort Johnson, last night and were repulsed. The fleet on the Stono has dropped drown below Battery Island. The force operating against this place since the 2nd instant sailed from Hilton Head on the 1st, and composes three brigades, viz, Hatch's, Birney's, and Saxton's, and the force heretofore on Morris, Folly, and adjacent islands, Major-General Foster commanding in person. This I get from his confidential order, taken from one of his colonels in the field.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.
