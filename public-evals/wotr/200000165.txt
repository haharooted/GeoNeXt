Major-General HALLECK,

Commanding the Army.

Numbers 2. Reports of Brigadier General Isaac J. Wistar, U. S. Army, commanding expedition.

FORT MAGRUDER, February 6, 1864-10 a. m.

My infantry and artillery are now passing through Williamsburg, 2 miles from here, with small detachment some distance ahead to scatter enemy's infantry pickets, with the impression that they constitute the incursive force as usual. Cavalry and myself will start in one hour, passing infantry near Burnt Ordinary. Saw every detachment commander personally, and explained fully and distributed maps, spikes, matches, and files. All is well. General Graham here in command. If possible, will get news through to you by Monday night.

I. J. WISTAR,

Brigadier-General.
