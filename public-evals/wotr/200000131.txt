LYNCHBURG, February 29, 1864.

I transmit dispatch from General Lee:

Enemy's cavalry are near Charlottesville; prepare to meet them if they come to Lynchburg.

I cannot tell whether this dispatch is subsequent to the one from Captain Mallory at 8 p. m., that announced that the enemy had been driven back. I have no force but what I can get here from the citizens. I shall telegraph Captain Mallory.

FRANCIS T. NICHOLLS,

Brigadier-General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
