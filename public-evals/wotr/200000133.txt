Numbers 22. Reports of Brigadier General Wesley Merritt, U. S. Army, commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,
Barnett's Ford, February 7, 1864.

Arrived here last evening late. Chapman's brigade last night found but little opposition on approaching ford. I am starting now to feel the enemy. Lomax is here below near Peyton's Ford. But little loss yet. There is danger of my return being interfered with by infantry unless ours keeps up demonstration. The roads are in very horrible condition, much worse than I expected. This will be telegraphed from Culpeper. Please communicate.

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General.
