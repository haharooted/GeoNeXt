HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,
Santa Fe, N. Mex., September 27, 1862.

Major General HENRY W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I turst you will have time to read this short private note. In organizing the small force known as the Column from California, and in conducting it over the Yuma and Gila deserts to the Rio Grande, the assistance rendered by my second in command, Colonel Joseph R. West, First Infantry California Volunteers, was of the most efficient character. The zeal, energy, and high soldierly qualities of this officer demand more than a passing notice. He should receive promotion to the grade of brigadier-general of volunteers. I earnestly recommend him to your favorable consideration, not only because he is your personal friend and a Californian, but because of the efficient and important services he has rendered and is rendering, and because of the size and importance of his present trust as commander of the District of Arizona, which comprises the Territory of that name, all of New Mexico south of Fort Thorn, and Northwestern Texas. I beg also to recommend First Lieutenant John B. Shinn, U. S. Third Artillery, and First Lieutenant Franklin Harwood, of the Topographical Engineers, to be brevetted, the former as a major. He is now first for promotion to a captaincy. The latter as a captain. The uncommon labor and zeal shown by these officers in bringing a light battery through the desert, the first one that ever crossed it, and having it always in fighting condition, demand at least this reward. I am sure you will feel that they richly deserve this compliment. I beg you will pardon my trespassing upon your time, but as it is that these three gentlemen deserve this consideration on your part, I earnestly entreat that you will use your powerful influence in their behalf.

I am, general, very sincerely,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-Generalllll.
