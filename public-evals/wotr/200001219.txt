SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., October 31, 1862.

Adjt. General L. THOMAS,

Washington, D. C.:

All the companies of Washington Territory volunteers required have been organized, and I find one extra company at Alcatraz Island. Can I retain this company in a new regiment for California, or transfer it to the Oregon cavalry?

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
