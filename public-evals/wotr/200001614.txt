HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, Cal., September 8, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: For the information of the General-in-Chief I have the honor to forward herewith a report of Major David Fergusson, First Cavalry California Volunteers, commanding the District of Western Arizona, on the subject of transportation of supplies from this city to the troops of General Carleton's command in advance of Fort Yuma. * In a previous communication addressed to you I asked for authority to send the supplies through the State of Sonora. By doing so a very great saving can be made in the cost of transportation, and in anticipation of approval I am now making arrangements for shipping the next supplies to one of the three ports in Sonora referred to, probably Libertad, from whence we shall have no difficulties to encounter in transporating the stores to Tuscon safely and economically.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
