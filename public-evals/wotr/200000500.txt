HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,
Saint Louis, Mo., April 11, 1864.

General RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

If the General-in-Chief accedes to my views of allowing two good disciplined regiments of cavalry from without the State for this department, ask him to please let me have the Second Iowa and Third Michigan. The Seventh Kansas is a good fighting regiment, but would be less likely to answer our purpose here.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
