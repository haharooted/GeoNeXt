HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, Cal., October 1, 1862.

Colonel GEORGE W. BOWIE,

Fifth Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding District of Southern California, Fort Yuma, Cal.:

SIR: The course pursued by you with reference to the movement of troops from Fort Yuma is approved by the general commanding. The general directs that you will leave two companeis at Fort Yuma, the captain of one, to be a reliable man, as commanding officer of the post. With the other two and your headquarters you will move to New San Pedro, bringing Lieutenant-Colonel Dobbins to the latter place. Should Colonel Dobbins tender his resignation you will forward the same, granting him leave of absence; otherwise the general will consider the propriety of discharging him from the service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
