Tucson, Ariz. Ter., September 24, 1862.

Lieutenant J. F. GUIRADO,

First Cavalry California Volunteers:

SIR: You will proceed this evening with your detachment and resume command at San Pedro Crossing. To prevent any future stampedes by Indians you will habitually keep all your horses tied to the picket-line. They will be fed full allowance of hay and grain when on hand. You will also cause your men to cut green grass for them and feed then as much as they can eat, but they must be exercised. For this purpose you will drill your men daily for at least one hour and a half. Should there be any persns encamping near your station with stock, you will order them to guard their stock in such a manner as to insure their safety and prevent their offering inducements by their carelessness to Indians to prowl around your post to steal animals. Should any party refuse to comply with such instructions as you give, you will order them away from your station to such a distance as you choose. You may graze your animals within sight of your station where there may be good grass, but each horse must be held by a trooper by a riata, and each trooper must be fully armed and equipped and have his bridle ready to put on his horse, so that he can mount at once and follow any hostile Indians that may appear when your order them pursued without delay. The horses must not be grazed within wunshot of woods, chaparral or brush, where Indians can be concealed, and every man in your command must be ready at a moment's notice, night or day, to spring to arms. The horses when on the picket-line will be guarded by at least one armed sentinel in the daytime and two by night. You must omit no precaution to save your animals from being run off, or your post from being attacked.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. FERGUSSON,

Major, First Cavalry California Volunteers, Commanding.
