HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,
Fort Humboldt, July 10, 1863.

COLONEL; Yesterday a private train, which had been transporting Government stores to Fort Gaston, was attacked at Redwood Creek on its return by Indians. The escort consisted of eighteen men of the Weaverville company, not yet organized, together with five packers. The attack was finally repulsed with the loss of ten of our men wounded one or more of them mortally. The escort was detailed by Captain Fleming who considers the men belonging to the companies not yet complete as being under his own independent command. For the particulars I therefore refer you to his report,* which will go down by this steamer. The present steamer brought me no dispatches from your headquarters.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,

Colonel Second Infantry California Vols., Commanding Humboldt Mil. Dist.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Pacific.
