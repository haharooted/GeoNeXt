[Fourth indorsement.]

ORDNANCE OFFICE,

June 14, 1864.

Respectfully returned to Major-General Halleck, Chief of Staff.

I approve of the recommendation of Admiral Farragut, believing that guns of heavier caliber than are now mounted are wanted for the fortifications of pensacola Harbor. The four 15-inch guns will be supplied by this Department, and with implements, carriages, and ammunition, whenever the arrangements for mounting them are completed and a requisition for them is made to this office.

GEO. D. RAMSAY,

Brigadier-General, Ordnance.
