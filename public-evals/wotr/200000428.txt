WASHINGTON, D. C., April 12, 1864-2 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your report of transportation shows over 1,600 teams in the department. It is impossible to supply the necessary transportation for the army in Tennessee in time for spring operations. Can you not send the mules of 500 of your teams to Louisville at once? Send all you can.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
