COVINGTON, KY., January 12, 1865.

ADJUTANT- GENERAL OF THE ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

SIR: As a great many malicious misrepresentations have been spread before the county in regard to my conduct of the campaign into Northeast MISSISSIPPI last summer, by which I have been placed in a false and injurious light before the people and the Government, I would respectfully ask that an opportunity be afforded me of defending myself before a court of inquiry composed of intelligent officers of experience. In case it should be deemed impracticable to order such a court at this time, I would respectfully ask that I be ordered to report in person to the honorable Secretary of War in order that I may be enabled to place myself right, at least, before the Government. I have thus far and for a long time borne quietly, and with as much patience as I could command, the thousand calumnies which have been heaped upon my head, and which (unintentionally, I am sure) have received more or less confirmation by the course which the War Department has been pleased to adopt in regard to me, but I have never abandoned the hope that a just Government, and one to whose interests I have devoted over twenty- two of the best years of my life, would, sooner or later, afford me that hearing which is due to my long and faithful service- due to those friends who have stood by me through evil as well as through good report- due to the truth of history, and due in an eminent degree to abstract justice itself.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier- General, U. S. Volunteers.
