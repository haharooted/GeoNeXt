BOONVILLE, MO., June 1, 1864.

C. A. HANNAMAN,

Assistant Superintendent U. S. Military Telegraph:

Reliable information has been given to several prominent citizens here that a large force, numbering some 3,000, are concentrating in the immediate vicinity of Quincy, Hickory County, and their scouts have been as far as Osceola, Saint Clair County. It is anticipated that the same movement will be made by the rebels as when they entered here last October; that they are now making a demonstration toward Warrensburg, while the larger body moves on this place. It is the wish of several citizens that this should be sent and shown to General Rosecrans.

JAY D. DUNNING,

Operator.
