HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,
Denver, Colo., Ter., May 29, 1864.

Major E. W. WYNKOOP,

Fort Lyon, Colo., Ter.:

MAJOR: You had better send a company or two to Wilson's camp, whenever re-enforcements are in reach of you, and instruct the officer in command not to be surprised; also instruct him to break up whisky selling to Indians, and to do this last if he has to break the neck of the offender. A train of supplies ordnance, &c., left yesterday for your post.

I am, sir, with much respect, your obedient servant,

J. M. CHIVINGTON,

Colonel First Cavalry of Colorado, Commanding District.
