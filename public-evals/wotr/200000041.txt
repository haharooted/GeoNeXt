HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,
Tunnel Hill, May 9, 1864-7 a. m.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON,

Commanding, &c., Snake Creek Gap:

GENERAL: I have heard from Corse. Garrard will surely be with you to-day. General Hooker will be ready to move to you on a signal. General Kilpatrick can operate directly on your flank till General Garrard gets up. You can send your trains up this valley to Ringgold, not exposing them at all in Chickamauga Valley. The railroad is now done to this depot. We will push the enemy at all points to-day, ready to take advantage of the effect of your movement. Open communication with General Hooker by signals.

I am, yours, &c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
