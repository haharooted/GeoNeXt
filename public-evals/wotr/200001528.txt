FORT SUMTER, February 24,1 864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that Captain China, 2 lieutenants, and 50 men from the Twenty-fifth relieved Captain Carson's detachment last night, and Captain Brown, 3 officers, and 50 men from the Twenty-seventh relieved Lieutenant Lance. Weather hazy. I omitted to mention yesterday that after the morning report was sent in on Monday the Ironsides was distinctly seen to fire two salutes, one at meridian, another at sunset. This sets at rest the question as to her armament being on board.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
