HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,
In the Field, Tunnel Hill, Ga., May 10, 1864-7 a. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:

I am starting for the extreme front in Buzzard Roost Gap, and write this dispatch that you may understand. Johnston acts purely on the defensive. I am attacking him on his strongest fronts, viz, west and north, till McPherson breaks his line at Resaca, when I will swing round through Snake Creek Gap, and interpose between him and Georgia. I am not driving things too fast, because I want two columns of cavalry that are rapidly coming up to me from the rear, Stoneman on my left and Garrard on my right, both due to-day. Yesterday I pressed hard to prevent Johnston detaching against McPherson, but to-day I will be more easy, as I believe McPherson has destroyed Resaca, when he is ordered to fall back to mouth of Snake Creek Gap and act against Johnston's flank when he does start. All are in good condition.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
