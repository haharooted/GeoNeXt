OFFICE CHIEF OF ARTILLERY, NORTHERN DIST., DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,

Morris Island, S. C., June 7, 1864.

Lieutenant W. B. DEAN,

A. A. A. G., Hdqrs. Northern Dist., Dept. of the South:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that at daylight on June 7, a small river steamer was discovered from Fort Putnam aground on a shall 3,200 yards from the above-named fort. The position of the steamer was a point on a line drawn from the flag-staff in Putnam to the left (enemy's) of Castle Pinckney. No boats were seen to leave the steamer; neither did she have steam up when discovered. She probably was abandoned at the time of grounding, and the steam allowed to escape. The steamer was, at the time of running ashore, returning from Fort Sumter to the city. Fire was at once opened upon her with a 200-pounder rifle Fort Putnam and one 100-pounder from Battery Chatfield. At 6 a. m., two 100-pounders were from Fort Strong, also one 30-pounder from Fort Putnam. The effect upon the vessel procured by these guns was very good. A shell from Fort Strong carried away the smoke-pike. The upper works of the steamer were struck many times, and are broken up. Thirty shells struck the hull of the steamer, causing her to fill and sick to a level with her decks. The guns in Fort Strong were ordered to cease firing at noon. One 100-pounder rifle (Parrott) was burst in Fort Strong during the firing, also one in Battery Chatfield. The firing from 12 m. until 6 p. m. was from one 100-pounder in Battery Chatfield and one 200-pounder in Fort Putnam.

From daylight until 10 a. m., the enemy kept up a heavy fire upon our works from the James Island batteries. They fired 284 shot and shell during this time. There were no casualties. The only damage done by enemy's shell was to the slopes and parapets of our works. The steamer is now a complete wreck, rendered so by the following expenditure of ammunition on our part, viz:

Rounds.

Fort Putnam.......................................... 132

Fort Strong.......................................... 57

Battery Chatfield.................................... 78

Total................................................ 267

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. AMES,

Lieutenant-Colonel Third Rhode Island Artillery, Chief of Artillery, Northern District, Dept. of the South.
