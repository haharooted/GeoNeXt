CHARLESTON, S. C., July 7, 1864.

My telegram of the 4th to General Cooper communicated result to that time of attacks and maneuvers on this place, commenced on morning of the 2nd instant, expressed opinion that this city was in serious danger, that assistance should be sent to me speedily, and that I had received none of the reserves of this State. Subsequent events conform me to belief that this city is in great danger and that I greatly need re-enforcements. Enemy occupy south end of James Island and have position on John's Island form which they can enfilade our works on James Island. Fleet of two monitors and several gun-boats in Stono heavily shelling us. I have called on Generals Johnston, Whiting, and Chesnut for aid. Johnston alone has responded,sending me 520 men. Can I look for re-enforcements form any quarter? The emergency is pressing. My troops greatly exhausted.

Major-General.
