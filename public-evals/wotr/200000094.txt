HEADQUARTERS DIVISION,
February 6, 1864-9. 30 p. m.

I have the honor to report all quiet. The scouting party sent out yesterday returned this afternoon from Aldie and Middleburg. Their rear guard was attacked yesterday noon by 8 of Mosby's men; they were dispersed, and the leader, who proved to be William E. Ormsby, who deserted from Second Massachusetts Cavalry on the night of January 24, was captured, and is now being tried by drumhead court-martial. * Two men of the Second Massachusetts Cavalry and 3 rebels were wounded. Five citizens were arrested under suspicious circumstances. No evidence was found of any five being in the vicinity.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
