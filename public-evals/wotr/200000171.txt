LYNCHBURG, February 29, 1864.

I have just received the following dispatch from Captain Mallory, commanding at Charlottesville:

Enemy burned county bridge on road to Earlysville, and last information states they are retreating toward Greene County, from whence they came. They came within 4 miles of town when they were driven across the river at Rio Mills. Force not known; supposed to be 1,000; all cavalry. You need not send any troops until you hear from me again.

I have telegraphed Captain Mallory to keep me advised and will transmit to you his dispatches to me.

FRANCIS T. NICHOLS,

Brigadier-General.

General S. COOPER.
