HDQRS. NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS, May 31, 1864

Brigadier-General LAWLER,
Commanding U. S. Forces at

Junction of Fordoche and Atchafalaya Roads:

GENERAL: I omitted to say in my dispatch of this afternoon that when you send the cavalry toward Rosedale to make the raid by way of Waterloo no artillery should be sent, as from your report of the roads which come across from the Bayou Grossetete to the Mississippi artillery cannot pass.

Very truly, yours,

W. H. EMORY.
