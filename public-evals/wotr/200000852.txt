FORT SUMTER, February 17, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report the fleet unchanged in number this morning. A working party is engaged remodeling the embrasures at Gregg and lowering their soles, which were much disturbed by the blast from the heavy guns. Two ladies were seen on the parapet of Wagner yesterday; they were afterwards observed to visit the Ironsides. One shell fired at flag yesterday morning; three of the fragments took effect; also considered good shot.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
