SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., September 27, 1862.

(Received 11. 40 p. m. 28th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

It is too late to raise a new regiment and pass it over the southern route this season. The troops on this coast should not be sent beyond my control. They may be needed here.

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General.
