[Inclosure.] General WRIGHT, U. S. Army, Commanding Dept. of the Pacific, Headquarters at San Francisco:

SIR: We, the undersigned, loyal citizens of the United States of America, knowing that in the town of Benicia and vicinity there are persns, who, residing among loyal citizens, at every opportunity, on the reverses met by the Union forces, express their feelings in favor of the rebels, vindicating loudly their cause against the General Government, it is therefore asked of you, as the commanding officer of the Pacific Department, that you empower, or have stationed in your midst, a guard whose duty it would be to arrest those whom either they hear or is made known to them of uttering treasonable sentiments against our Government. This freedom of speech should not be tolerated. These secret workers in disloyalty should be stopped. Either remove them from the loyal sod or place them within the confines of Fort Alcatraz, beneath the emblem of our beloved country-thus the air will not be polluted by the expression of their treasonable designs. We leave the above to you, by enforcing the same you will meet with the approval of a large body of loyal citizens in our midst, and in duty bound we will ever pray.
