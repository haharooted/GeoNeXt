Major-General BUTLER.

FORT MAGRUDER, February 8, 1864.

Have just arrived after a 15-mile gallop with staff only from Burnt Ordinary, where I left the infantry and artillery strongly posted, with orders to march here at 6 a. m. The cavalry arrived here some time before me, having been sent forward for the want of forage. I regret your disappointment. It is no greater, i assure you, than mine. More might have been done for eclat by attacking the bridge; but under the circumstances, distance from base, no available troops in department to re-enforce me, evident preparation by enemy, and, above all, the entire defeat of the real object - in any event it would not have been wise in my judgment. Was I right? Have you any orders for the cavalry before it all leaves? I would like to use a little of it in Gloucester.

I. J. WISTAR,

Brigadier-General.
