Numbers 3. Reports of Brigadier General John C. Caldwell, U. S. Army, commanding Second Army Corps and First Division.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,
Stringfellow's House at Morton's Ford, Feb. 6, 1864-12. 30 p. m.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I have crossed two brigades at Morton's Ford with but little opposition, capturing 26 men and 2 officers, without losing a man; prisoners from Stonewall's old brigade; they report that there are but two brigades within 2 miles. The enemy is firing from three guns. I have not yet replied with my artillery, distance being too great. My skirmish line is within 800 to 1,000 yards of their rifle-pits, which appear to be manned. They are now showing more artillery, probably ten guns. I am now sending across another brigade. I do not purpose to advance without further orders or until the arrival of General Warren.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. CALDWELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Corps.
