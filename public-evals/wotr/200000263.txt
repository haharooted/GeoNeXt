HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 20, 1864.

Captain CAMERON,

Commanding at Cassville, Mo.:

Captain Human left Ozark early this morning. He was expecting to move across Rolling Prairie, and then toward Lebanon, in Searcy County, but would direct his courts in any direction that would lead him toward the enemy. Colonel Phelps will not attack a largely superior force unless absolutely necessary, until there is a full understanding between the commanders of the different detachments. He will take time and do the work well, if possible. Send this dispatch to him by any detachment leaving in that direction.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
