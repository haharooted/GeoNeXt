HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, Cal., September 10, 1862.

Colonel FRANNCIS J. LIPPITT,

Second Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding District of Humboldt, Fort Humboldt, Cal.:

SIR: From representations made by respectable parties it is feared that evil-disposed whites, sympathizers with secession, are stirring up the several Indian tribes in your district to make hostile incursions on the settlements. You will, the general commanding directs, endeavor to discover the parties who thus attempt to disturb the peace of the State and arrest and hold them in confinement until the receipt of further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
