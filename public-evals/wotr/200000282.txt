HEADQUARTERS,
White River, January 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Springfield, Mo.:

Dispatches just received from Captain Duff, at Berryville, report the enemy having fallen back to Rolling Prairie, Searcy County, under command of Colonel Hughes. I shall move on them as expeditiously as possible. Colonel Phelps is reported in the vicinity of Burrowsville, Ark. I will be detained in consequence of rations not having reached me. I will keep you advised of my movements, also that of the enemy.

C. B. HOLLAND,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
