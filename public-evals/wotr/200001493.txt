HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,
Saint Joseph, Mo., May 31, 1864.

Colonel J. T. K. HAYWARD,

Hannibal, Mo.:

Can you name the best militia company in Ralls County to be called into service for the summer? I am going to send an officer to Hannibal who will wage a war of sure and swift destruction against the murdering, thieving gang of villains that are now at work in Pike and neighboring counties. Shooting on the spot will be the rule.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
