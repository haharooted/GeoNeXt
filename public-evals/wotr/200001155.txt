HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,
Mesilla, September 27, 1862.

Lieutenant BEN. C. CUTLER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Santa Fe:

I have the honor to transmit, for the information of the general commanding, copy of my letter of instructions to the commanding officer at Tucson in reference to forwarding the 1,000 head of cattle coming from California. As stated to Major Coult, I am apprehensive that he will not have sufficient escorts to send the cattle through, compelled as he will be to divide them up into several bands. There seems good reason to believe that Captain Greene's company of infantry will have left Tucson before any of the cattle could reach there, and one-third of Captain Wellman's company of cavalry have already come through with an express. There seems now the greater occasion for sending Captain Cremony to relieve Captain Fritz, as suggested by me to the general in a private communication recently. Captain Fritz if thus relieved can bring the remainder of the cattle through. This is submitted for the better judgment of the general commanding.

Your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
