Major R. C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: In my report of the 15th August relative to certain transactions on Puget Sound in connection with the U. S. revenue cutter Shubrick, wherein the possibility was intimated of a requisition being made on me for troops to enforce the requirements of the law under a warrant, said to be resisted, to arrest Victor Smith, collector of customs, and Lieutenant Wilson, commander of the Shubrick, I have the honor to state that there is no further apprehension of a collision between the authorities of the Territory and the officers of the cutter, as the Shubrick has returned to the sound and is now at Olympia, where I understand both Mr. Smith and Lieutenant Wilson have consented to undergo a legal investigation of the matter alleged against them, for which the warrant of arrest was issued by the U. S. commissioner on the 11th ultimo.

Very respectfully, I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

G. W. PATTEN,

Major Ninth Infantry, Commanding.
