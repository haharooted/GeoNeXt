HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Hilton Head, S. C., July 10, 1864.

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to state that a siege train of five 20-pounder Parrott guns, four 10-inch siege mortars, two 8-inch siege howitzers, and one 24-pounder rifled gun will be sent to you to be placed in position wherever they may be required. If they are placed either on Black on James Island the battery must be made thoroughly secure against attack by surprise, made so by surrounding them with good, substantial picketing.

The major-general commanding further directs that the bombardment of Fort Sumter, as commenced, must be continued. He will be up on Tuesday or Wednesday next to examine it in person.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. L. M. BURGER,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
