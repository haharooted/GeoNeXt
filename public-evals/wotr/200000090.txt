Numbers 3. Reports of Brigadier General Eppa Hunton, C. S. Army.

HEADQUARTERS,
Chaffin's Farm, February 7, 1864.

MAJOR: The enemy reached Bottom's Bridge at 4. 15 o'clock last night, of which I presume you have been informed by Colonel Shinlger, who was directed to report all the enemy's movements to you by telegraph. I am anxious about the position above Bottom's Bridge, lest Colonel Shingler's position should be turned and his command endangered. If the enemy succeed in crossing the Chickahominy, I shall move out the rest of my command on the Varina and New Market roads. The artillery from the other side of the James River has not reported. Some firing has been heard this morning in t he direction of Bottom's Bridge. I have not heard a word from Major Robertson. Sent him a dispatch a little after light this morning, to know if any enemy menaced his front.

Respectfully, &c.,

EPPA HUNTON,

Brigadier-General.
