Brigadier-General STONE,

Chief of Staff:

I learn from a source upon which I think I can rely that Major Levy, of General Taylor's staff, came to New Iberia three days ago and went back yesterday morning. He staid at my informant's house, and his object was to send in the flag of truce. General Taylor is at Alexandria and has not been to New Iberia. There are 10,000 men, who can be increased to 16,000 in a few days. He says that there is a raft 3 miles long now, which will be 10 miles long when the river rises, commanded by Fort De Russy. There are about 250 cavalry in New Iberia. I think that there is no present danger here, but will report more fully to-morrow. I arrived here this morning.

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.
