CAMP NELSON, June 11, 1864.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

Should you ascertain that an attack upon this place is contemplated by anything like a formidable force, I should like, if you could spare them from Lexington, to have some 400 or 500 sent here, either cavalry or infantry. A large portion of the men upon whom I have to depend are clerks and employees in quartermaster's and commissary departments, very few of whom have ever been drilled or disciplined for military duty. Anything more from Hobson?

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
