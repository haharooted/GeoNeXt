Report of Lieutenant Colonel William Baumer, First Nebraska Cavalry.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST NEBRASKA CAVALRY,
Batesville, Ark., February 21, 1864.

CAPTAIN: In accordance with verbal instructions received from Colonel Livingston, First Regiment Nebraska Cavalry, commanding district, I left Batesville at 7 a. m. on the 12th instant, in search of Colonel Freeman's command. Weather was clear and pleasant. Started in a northeasterly direction and traveled 6 miles and then halted to close up the column. At noon we crossed junction of Mount Olive and Hookram and Mount Olive and Batesville roads. Just before reaching this point met two flags of truce from Freeman's command, bringing in Captain Rouch and 18 privates of the Eleventh Missouri Cavalry, for exchange. At cross-roads deployed skirmishers in the hills, and halted for ten minutes to rest the animals; distance to this point, 12 miles. At 1.30 p. m. passed Curia Post-Ofice, taking Hookram road, 20 miles from Batesville. Up to this point we passed no plantations that had either forage or beef-cattle. One mile from McCord's struck headquarters of Spring Creek and followed down its valley to Hookram. Passing through Hookram we turned in a westerly direction and pushed on the Widow Martin's, 2 1\2 miles distant from Hookram. We camped here of the night and had corn and fodder for the animals. Mrs. Love (Widow Martin's daughter) has two head of beef-cattle (poor), which she is desirous of selling. Gave receipts for all forage used. One mile east of Widow Martin's crossed Salem road. Day's march, 28 miles.
