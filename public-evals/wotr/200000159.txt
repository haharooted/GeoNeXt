Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

FORT MONROE, February 8, 1864-10. 55 p. m.

(Received 11 p. m.)

I have sent the following telegram to the President, and I duplicate to you in order that you may urge my request upon him:

Honorable ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

After much preparation I made a raid on Richmond to release our prisoners there. Everything worked precisely as I expected. The troops reached Bottom's Bridge, 10 miles from Richmond, at 2. 30 o'clock on Sunday morning, but we found a force of the enemy posted there to meet us, evidently informed of our intention, none having been there before for two months. They had destroyed the bridge and fallen threes across the road to prevent the passing of the cavalry. Finding the enemy were informed and prepared, we were obliged to retire. The flag-of-truce boat came down from Richmond to-day, bringing a copy of the Examiner, in which it is said that they were prepared for us from information received from a Yankee deserter. Who that deserter was that gave the information you will see by a dispatch just received by me from General Wistar. I send it to you that you may see how your clemency has been misplaced. I desire that you will revoke your order suspending executions in this department. Please answer by telegraph.
