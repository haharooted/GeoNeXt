OFFICE CHIEF OF ARTILLERY, NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Folly Island, S. C., July 27, 1864.

Lieutenant W. B. DEAN,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Northern Dist., Dept. of the South:

SIR: I have the honor to report the firing upon Fort Sumter as still continued with good effect. The points against which our fire has been directed are, viz: First, the angle formed by the junction of sea and gorge walls; second, the right (enemy's) angle of the fort. The first-mentioned point has been much cut away, and, in my opinion, is the point against which the whole fire should be directed. The right angle of the fort has been cut away for about 8 or 9 feet. The progress made at this point, however, has been very slow. So many of the guns used in breaching have been disabled that I have ordered the fire of the remaining guns to be directed against the center angle. During this bombardment great inconvenience has been experiences from the premature explosion of shells, notwithstanding that all the projectiles fired were thoroughly examined before being filled, and the fuse plugs well covered with white lead previous to being screwed in; still these premature explosions take place. The plan of varnishing the interior surface of the shells, as recommended by R. P. Parrott, has not as yet been put into practice, owing to there being no varnish in the ordnance department. Twelve 30-pounder shells prepared in this way were fired without any premature explosions. This is not a fair trail, however, but as soon as varnish arrives from Hilton Head it will be more thoroughly tested.

The following guns have been disabled during the past week: Numbers 3 gun (200 Parrott), Fort Putnam burst July 25 at the 1,300th round. Numbers 4 gun (200-pounder Parrott), Fort Putnam, requires a new vent. Numbers 3 gun (200-pounder Parrott), Battery Chatfield, ditto. Numbers 2 gun, 10-inch columbiad (colored battery), has bad about 18 inches of its muzzle blown off by the premature explosion of a shell. This gun is still being fired, and will serve well for short range. One new 200-pounder Parrott is being mounted in fort putnam to replace Numbers 3 gun, burst. New vents will be placed in the guns requiring them as soon as material for bushing is received by the ordnance department.

The only reserve guns on hand in this district are, viz: One 300-pounder Parrott, for which there is no carriage or chassis, and one 100-pounder Parrott complete. There re no smooth-bore guns on hand at ordnance yard.

The following number of projectiles have been expended in the bombardment of Fort Sumter from July 7 to July 21, inclusive:

Fort Putnam: 764 30-pounders, 294 200-pounders, 173 300-pounders, 98 10-inch columbiad; total, 928.

Fort Strong: 1,146 100-pounders, 142 200-pounders;total, 1,288.

Battery Barton: 729 10-inch mortars.

Thirteen-inch mortar battery; 91 13-inch mortars.

Number of rounds from each work: Putnam, 1,947 rounds; Chatfield, 928 rounds; Strong, 1,288 rounds; barton, 729 rounds; Seymour, 542 rounds; 13-inch mortar, 91 rounds; total, 5,525.

Number and kind of projectiles; 764 30-pounders, 1,509 100-pounders, 1,619 200-pounders, 173 300-pounders, 98 10-inch columbiad, 1,271 10-inch sea-coast mortars, 91 13-inch mortars; total, 5,525.
