May 9, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

So long as we are in connection I can hold the hill with one and a half brigades. Wagner swings into the valley on your right front. This must count as one brigade.

J. NEWTON,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-You might always swing back on this hill, under any state of affairs.
