Commanding Dept. of Kansas, Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

Lieutenant Dunn, First Cavalry of Colorado, had a fight with a party of Cheyenne Indians on north side of Platte River, near Fremont's Orchard, on 12th instant; had 4 men badly wounded and killed a number of Indians. They are stealing stock in every direction and refusing to give it up. I have a strong detachment on headwaters Smoky Hill Fork, after party which stole 175 head of Irwin, Jackman & Co.'s oxen. I shall chastise them severely unless you direct differently.
