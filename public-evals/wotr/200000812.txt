FORT SUMTER, February 14, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that 3 shots were fired at the fort yesterday, all of which struck. As our flag was being lowered a single shot was fired which cut off the staff near the top; it was regarded generally as being a good shot. Steam water-boat arrived last night. Banded 32-pounder rifle shipped to the city. Weather foggy; no observation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
