CAMP MILTON, NEAR McGIRT'S CREEK, FLA., March 7, 1864.

All quiet here at present. General Gillmore is reported having left Jacksonville for Hilton Head on learning my arrival here, probably to make a demonstration against Charleston or Savannah. I have telegraphed Generals Jordan and Mercer to be prepared accordingly. Enemy's wounded taken at Ocean Pond represent twenty-eight regiments and battalions.
