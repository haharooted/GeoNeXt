PROSPECT, May 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Decatur, Ala.:

Received your telegram of this date. Have one 6-gun battery and 3,000 infantry, but a good part of them are new recruits. The enemy is reported on the road leading from Rogersville to this place. I think I will bring the Seventeenth Wisconsin up here to-night. Don't think we are strong enough to divide our force now. Three thousand infantry includes the Seventeenth Wisconsin. The balance of the Seventeenth Army Corps is either at Cairo or on their way up the Tennessee River. Have got a position that I can hold against a greatly superior force.

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.
