SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., September 25, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel RICHARD C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, U. S. Army, Hdqrs. Department of the Pacific:

COLONEL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of the copy of Brigadier-General Alvord's letter of the 10th instant, made official by yourself and addressed to me, probably, for my information. The act of Congress to which General Alvord alludes contemplates permanent defenses at the entrance of Columbia River, and in pursuance of that act I was directed by General Totten, chief engineer, to examine the several points at the entrance of the river and to prepare a project for such defenses, to be submitted to Washington for approval. The several plans and drawings, including surveys, which accompanied my report to the general, left here by the mail of the 20th of last month, and I am in hopes to receive further instructions from the Department about the 20th of next month.

Very respectfully, I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

R. E. DE RUSSY,

Lieutenant-Colonel of Engineers.
