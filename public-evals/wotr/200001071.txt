Brigadier General S. S. FRY:

It is reported, via Cincinnati and Louisville, that Burbridge came up with Morgan this morning near Cynthiana, and after an hour's fight completely broke him up. Am expecting news from General Burbridge by courier.

J. BATES DICKSON,
Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
