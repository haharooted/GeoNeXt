ROLLA, MO., May 31, 1864

Colonel SIGEL:

SIR: Under the present circumstances would it not be well to have Captain Roberts and Captain Meyers of the Sixty-third Regiment of Enrolled Missouri Militia,ordered into active service? In case of difficulty, in their unorganized condition, without arms, [they] could be but little assistance. Some of the citizens here are somewhat concerned for the safety of Rolla. I know not what grounds there may be to apprehend danger here; you of, course, have a better opportunity of judging. If you will give me the order I will proceed at once to organize those two companies. The citizens at Saint James are very much alarmed and are very anxious that a company of my men be placed there at once. Let me hear from you.

I. S. WARMOTH,

Colonel, Commanding Enrolled Missouri Militia.
