YORKTOWN, VA., March 6, 1864.

I left my camp at Stevensburg with 3,585 men, 6 guns, 8 caissons, 3 wagons, and 6 ambulances. I have now 3,317 men, 3,595 horses, 6 guns, 8 caissons, 3 wagons, and 4 ambulances. Colonel Dahlgren, with about 100 men, has been heard from to-day; he was then near King and Queen Court-House. I shall send some of my men to assist him. General Butler informs me that he has ample transportation for me. Troops can be crossed at Urbanna only at high tide. Dock destroyed. Can easily cross at Rappahannock. Gun-boats can cover my crossing.
