CLARKSVILLE, ARK., April 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General KIMBALL:

I have received private information that there are at least 300 rebels on the lines west of this 25 miles. At dark last evening I sent a scout of 25 men, under Lieutenant Roseman, to examine their position. The Union families have all been driven in from the country, so that rebels and their sympathizers have complete possession. I have nailed 23 within the last two weeks, and lost 2 taken prisoners and 2 badly wounded. There are about 400 rebels in this section, well mounted but indifferently armed.

G. M. WAUGH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
