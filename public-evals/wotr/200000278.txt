[Second indorsement.]

HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,
Port Hudson, La., February 5, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

One thousand men are furnished daily from the garrison to work on fortifications. As to the reports within referred to by the chief engineer, I have only to say that they are very incorrect, and to express my surprise that such reports,coming from the officer in question, should have produced the impression which they appear to have done upon the chief engineer.

GEO. L. ANDREWSS.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Post.
