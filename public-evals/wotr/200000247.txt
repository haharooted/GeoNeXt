HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
New Orleans, La., January 21, 1864

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Andrews, commanding,&c., at Port Hudson, who it is supposed, with his present force, can spare, for limited time, at least 500 men as a working party on the fortifications. It is important that these works should be completed at a much earlier time than indicated within.

By command of Major-General Banks:

GEO. B. DRAKE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
