HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,
Saint Louis, April 13, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Pilot Knob:

Has Captain Milks' company yet gone to Saint Genevieve to take station? I telegraphed you several days ago to know whether the three howitzers at Camp Curtis and the company at Centreville might not advantageously be sent to Patterson, but have yet received no answer.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
