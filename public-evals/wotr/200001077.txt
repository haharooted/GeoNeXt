WHITE'S STATION, June 14, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN, Memphis:

Have ordered infantry guard for the train. Sent small patrol beyond Germantown this morning, who returned, assisting about 100 stragglers in getting in. Have sent 100 cavalry to La Fayette and am sending 50 more to Germantown to remain until the 100 return from La Fayette. I suggest that rations be sent to Colonel Wolfe's brigade, and that they be allowed to remain here for a day or two.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.
