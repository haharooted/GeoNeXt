HEADQUARTERS POST,
Lexington, Mo., April 10, 1864.

Colonel JAMES McFERRAN,

Commanding 3rd Sub-Dist., Dist., of Cent. Mo., Warrensburg, Mo.:

COLONEL: I have to report that since my last report, of March 31, the troops at this post have made no scouts, being only a sufficient force for guard and escort duty. Company G has traveled a distance of 150 miles, or about 1 1/2 miles each, on escort duty. Company H has traveled a distance of 160 miles, or about 1 1/2 miles each, on escort duty. The troops at Mound Prairie Church have done some scouting in that vicinity, but can find no trace of bushwhackers. The troops at Republican Church killed a man by the name of Fear, said to belong to Gann's band of bushwhackers. With this exception they have found nothing of any further trace of bushwhackers.

I am, very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

ALEX. W. MULLINS,

Major First Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, Commanding.
