CAMP NELSON, June 12, 1864.

Captain DICKSON:

A dispatch just from Danville says: Provost-Marshal Cardwell of Mercer County, at Harrodsburg, reports that his scouts saw rebel pickets at Lawrenceburg, Anderson County, to-day, who say they have 300 men under Jack Allen. Have you any information of any rebels being in that section? This is the first intimation I have had of their being in that direction. I shall send out and ascertain, if I can, the truth and report, unless you have definite information on the subject. Please answer.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
