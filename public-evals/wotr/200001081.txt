CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON:

Some of our scouts have just come in; they part seeing the rebels crossing seven miles east of Lancaster, going toward Crab Orchard or Stanford. Our forces are still in pursuit. Colonel Weatherford has gone toward Stanford with 300 men. The rebels are reported nearly worn out, both men and horses. I hope our forces will overtake them to-night.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
