HEADQUARTERS,
Fort Bragg, Cal., May 21, 1863.

SIR: I do myself the honor to report that I proceeded on the 3rd instant from this post to Shelter Cove on scout with twenty men of my company to chastise a band of hostile Indians who have kileld several head of cattle and two valuable horses belonging to Mr. Beall, in that neighborhood. Earlyon the morning of the 9th instant, with eight men of the party surprised about thirty-five or forty of them, killing 4 and wounding 3, the latter so baldy that I found it useless to bring them along. Of the former, one has been recognized as concerned in the murder of two citizens (Oliver and Lewis) some time back. After this affair I proceeded to the vicinity of Eel River, but, notwithstanding the utmost caution was taken, those wary Indians discovered us and got out of range of our rifles. Their camp and several hudredweight of fish I caused to be destroyed. The detachment returned to this post this morning; 1 boy and 5 squaws brought in as prisoners, have been handed over to the superintendent of the Mendocino Reservation. The country through which the scout was made is almost impassable for underbrush and rocky ravines. The men did their dutywith good will and cheerfulness. I beg to recommend that another scouting party be sent to Eel River, for which I trust the colonel commanding will grant his approval.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. E. HULL,

Captain, Second California Volunteer Infantry, Commanding post.

First Lieutenant CHARLES H. BARTH,
