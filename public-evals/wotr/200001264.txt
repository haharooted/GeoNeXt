TEN-NE-MAH-HA-TE AND OTHER CHIEFS OF OWEN'S RIVER:

I am instructed by the Great Father at Washington to go to your country and talk with you. I shall be there on the 20th of September. In the meantime you must remain quiet and not allow your Indians to have any more difficulty with your white neighbors. Your Great Father has a good heart for all Indians who are obedient and do not fight. The Great Father regrets that the Indians have killed their white neighbors. This must not occur again. I shall take with me some food, clothing, and blankets for the chiefs. You have lands there, and shall be protected in your rights, but never go to war. When you have trouble with the whites, come to me or the agent who will be stationed there, and he will settle if for you.

JNO P. H. WENTWORTH,

Superintendent, Agent Southern District of California.
