FORT SUMTER, February 29, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report the Ironsides, 4 monitors, 3 wooden gun-boats, 5 tugs,a nd 12 sailing vessels in Light-House Inlet, and 5 blockaders outside. There are several vessels and a derrick near the sunken sloop of war. Two tugs came within half a mile of the fort last night. Fort Moultrie was notified of it and fired a few shots, upon which they retired. One shot was fired yesterday, which missed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
