JANUARY 18, 1864

Colonel POWELL CLAYTON, Pine Bluff:

Major-General Steele directs that you move at once upon the enemy in the vicinity of Monticello, using all your cavalry for the purpose. You can best judge weather you can take artillery. If you can safely, and so as not to retard the movement, it may be well to do so.

F. H. MANTER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
