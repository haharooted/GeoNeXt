Warrensburg, Mo., April 13, 1864.

Second Lieutenant A. L. GOODING,

Company H, Second Colorado Cavalry

(Through Colonel James H. Ford, comdg. 4th Sub-Dist., Kansas City):

LIEUTENANT: I am directed by the general commanding to acknowledge the receipt, through headquarters Fourth Sub-district, of your report, dated 8th instant, and to say that the thorough and efficient manner in which you have scouted the section of country referred to, and the subsequent excellent report of the same, merits and receives the thanks of the commanding general. Such work will certainly prevent bushwhackers from obtaining a hold in the country.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
