MEMPHIS, TENN., June 14, 1864.

(Received 12. 12 p. m. 16th.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

The affair of Sturgis's not as bad as he first represented. Loss will probably be reduced to 1,500 or 2,000. The force of the enemy consisted of the commands of S. D. Lee, Forrest, and Roddey, with infantry from Mobile, estimated at 15,000. Of 1,300 colored troops sent out, about 800 escaped. They fought desperately, and I hear were well treated by their captors.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
