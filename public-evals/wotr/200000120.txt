HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 17, 1864.

General ROBERT E. LEE,
Commanding Army of Northern Virginia:

GENERAL; I received on the 15th on the 15th instant, per flag of truce, your communication of the 1st instant, transmitting photographic copies of two documents alleged to have been found upon the body of Colonel U. Dahlgren, and inquiring "whether the signs and instructions of Colonel Dahlgren, as set forth in these papers, particularly those contained in the above extracts, were authorized by the United States Government or by his superior officers, and also whether they have the sanction and approval of these authorities. " In reply I have to state the neither the United States Government, myself, nor General Kilpatrick authorized, sanctioned, or approved the burning of the city of Richmond and the killing of Mr. Davis and cabinet, nor any other act not required by military necessity and in accordance with the usages of war.

In confirmation of this statement I inclose a letter from General Kilpatrick, and have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
