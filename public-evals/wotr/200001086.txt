CAMP NELSON, June 13, 1864.

Captain DICKSON:

A courier from the detachment sent in pursuit of rebels says the rebels are making off toward mouth of Paint Lick, on Kentucky River. Captain Santmeyer, who sends dispatch, says they are reported 1,000 strong. Excitement is apt to exaggerate. The report is too big.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
