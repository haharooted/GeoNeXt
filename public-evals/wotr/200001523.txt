FORT SUMTER, March 21, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report no change in the fleet, excepting the Wabash not in sight. A working party was observed at the Swamp Angel yesterday. I communicated the fact to Colonel Yates, who opened upon them. Two shots fired at the fort; 1 missed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
