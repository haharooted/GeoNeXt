SAINT LOUIS, January 30, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Division of the Mississippi, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: Having turned over the command of the Department of the Missouri to Major-General Rosecrans, in compliance with General Orders, Numbers 28, current series, from the War Department, I have the honor to report to you for orders. Will you please give me an order for myself and 4 staff officers, 6 horses, and baggage, from Saint Louis to Knoxville? Also, as I shall probably leave Saint Louis before receiving the order of the President assigning me to the command of the Department of the Ohio, it will, I presume, be necessary for me to have your order to assume that command on my arrival at Knoxville. I will be ready to start for Knoxville to-morrow evening.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
