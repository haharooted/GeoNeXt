LOUISVILLE, KY., June 13, 1864.

(Received 6. 50 p. m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

At the request of General Ewing, I ordered from Nashville to Bowling Green two incomplete regiments of colored troops, to guard, in the present emergency, the Louisville and Nashville road. I will complete their organization and use them for recruiting purposes. The prospects is good for a large number of colored troops in this State. The Union men are decidedly in favor of it, believing this the only way to control and save the Union, and I care not for the opposition of the rebel citizens or Southern sympathizers.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
