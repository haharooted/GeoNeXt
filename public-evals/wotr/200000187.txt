A party of 300 of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, under Captain Ackerly, of that regiment, sent out early yesterday morning to scout through Gloucester County, returned this morning, bringing in 5 prisoners and their horses. A detailed report will be duly forwarded. There does not appear to be more than a very small number of the enemy in Gloucester or adjacent counties. They are scattered and difficult to find.
