HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
New Orleans, La., January 26, 1864.

Major General F. J. HERRON,

Commanding U. S. Forces on the Rio Grande:

GENERAL: I have received your dispatches of them 17th, giving an account of the affair at Matamoras, and the intervention of the troops to cover the removal of the American consul with his property. This act seems to have been necessary, and in nowise a departure from the instructions you received. I have forwarded copies of all the dispatches, including that embracing general information in regard to Mexican affairs, for which you will accept my thanks, to the Department of War. Colonel Bertram's official conduct richly deserves the approval you bestow upon it. I have been acquainted with him since the commencement of the war, and never have known him to fail in the discharge of the most delicate and important duties that have been assigned to him.

With much respect, I remain, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
