HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,
Plaquemine, La., January 19, 1864.

Brigadier General CHARLES P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, Department of the Gulf:

SIR: The troops I have here now are the Forty-second and One hundred and twentieth Ohio Infantry, the Second Ohio Battery, and the one company of Fourth Wisconsin Cavalry. The battery has two 6-pounder James rifles and two 12-pounder howitzers. The battery has 94 men present, the cavalry 42; the infantry numbers 730, including sick and convalescent. There are very few sick, however. There is no gun-boat here. The fort is in rapid process of completion, and would have been, done ere this had not the weather been so bad. If I could have four 20-pounder guns to mount I think there would be no difficulty in resisting any attack the enemy may make. I should like them soon. However, there is no present danger of an attack.

Very respectfully,

L. A. SHELDON,

Colonel, Commanding.
