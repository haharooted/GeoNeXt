SPRINGFIELD, MO., January 21, 1864

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.:

Colonel Phelps, commanding Second Arkansas Cavalry, dispatches from Berryville on the 18th instant that Gunning with 400 men was 40 miles south of there, Captain Human, with the First Battalion Eighth Missouri State Militia, approaching them from the east through Yellville, and Captain Galloway from the west, through Huntsville, with a battalion, and Colonel Phelps from the north.

Commanders of these detachments are directed to communicate with each other and then make a combined attack upon the rebels in that region. It is not believed the rebels can concentrate more than 1,000 men, and it is expected that the movement will result in their destruction or expulsion from that part of Arkansas.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
