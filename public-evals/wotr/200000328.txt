HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,
Springfield, Mo., January 31, 1864.

Captain CAMERON,

Commanding at Cassville, Mo.:

I do see that you can reduce your mounted force any more with safety, or make any better disposition of troops. If there is plenty of forage at Berryville and Rolling Prairie, I think the troops operating in Arkansas, after sufficiently scouting Searcy and Newton Counties, had better be brought back to these places, with perhaps a part on White River in the vicinity of Bufallo. Not less than seven or eight squadrons should be left on Rolling Prairie, if any. If the river continues fordable and there are no new developments, I think now that I will send seven squadrons of the Sixth Provisional Regiment to Rolling Prairie in a few days. You may send this to General Holland when you send forward dispatches. Phelps had better move up from Berryville. Have General Holland move far so from Berryville [sic].

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
