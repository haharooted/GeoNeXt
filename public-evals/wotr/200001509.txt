FORT SUMTER, January 13,1 864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that nothing of importance has occurred since my last report, with the exception of the unmasking of one or more light Parrott guns than have heretofore been employed. They are situated at the foot of the scarp of the main work of Gregg. No observation can be made this morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
