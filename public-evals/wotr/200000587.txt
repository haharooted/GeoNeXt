SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 15, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.:

From news by telegraph it would seem Buford is not where he is for nothing. Commissary supplies are being laid in, and provisions collected on White River, and the secret rebel order in this State is actively organizing, and lines of probable movements form Arkansas this way indicated. Can't Buford and Co. be driven from West Tennessee?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
