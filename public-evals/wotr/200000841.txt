FORT SUMTER, February 4, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that 3 shots were fired at the fort yesterday morning which struck, and 3 last night, which exploded over head. A rifled 42-pounder was mounted night before last in the northwest pan-coupe. One monitor is firing 11-inch and 15-inch shells at the wreck this morning. The sea being smooth the ricochet fire is effective.

The fleet consists of Ironsides, 4 monitors, 14 sailing vessels, 2 gun-boats, 1 tug inside; 10 schooners, 5 steamers in Light-House Inlet; 5 blockaders and 2 schooners outside; 4 steamers, 8 schooners, and 3 steam derricks in Light-House Inlet.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
