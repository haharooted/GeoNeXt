CHARLESTON, July 5, 1864.

No material change here since yesterday. Enemy hold south end James Island, with increased force. Their fleet of monitors in Stono incessantly shelling our lines. Officers captured say this is a carefully matured plan of attack on Charleston, which it is confidently expected will succeed. General Johnston has ordered two regiments to me. I need more.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER.
