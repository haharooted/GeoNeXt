12th.-During he night we heard nothing of the enemy, and in the morning we were informed that Freeman was marching to Couch's place, some 10 miles in the direction of Thomasville. Of course we expected that he was going there to meet and fight us.

We were on the march in good time, and arrived at Couch's about 10 a. m., but Freeman was not there, and now we could see wherein Freeman had out generale us, and instead of going to Couch's had gone some place else. We halted here for dinner, and then resumed our march. About 8 miles farther on we saw 2 men mount and run. We pursued and shot both of them. They were dressed in Federal uniform. We marched on to Thomasville and camped for the night, having marched 23 miles. 13th.-Marched to James Harris', on Turkey Oak, and camped; marched 18 miles. 14th.-This day was spent in gathering together families to move north, and in scouting through the neighborhood. 15.-Marched to Eaton's, on Jack's Fork; distance, 20 miles. 16th.-We left a guard with the teams and came into Houston without making any further discoveries; distance, 22 miles. 17th.-Started in search of some rebels said to be on Possum Creek; found no signs, and camped at the house of Mr. Coats;marched 20 miles. 18th.-Marched down Possum to Joe Harris' place. Learned here that the guerrilla Bill Coats had been the night before at a house on Hamilton Creek. We learned that Coats had moved his camp to Big Piney. We went across to Piney, near James Johnson's place, and there scattered through the hills, hoping that some one of us might come upon the camp. We found nothing however, and all camped together at Smiley's Mill; marched 24 miles. 19th.-We scouted on Piney and Possum, but found nothing; camped at Jos. Gladdon's place; distance, 20 miles.
