Colonel JOSEPH R. WEST,

Commanding District of Arizona, Mesilla:

COLONEL: In pursuance of my purpose not to keep any one company for a long while at Fort Bowie, Chiricahua Mountains, you are authorized to relieve Captain Hinds' company by Captain Ford's as soon as it may be, in your judgment, practicable to do so. When thus relieved, Captain Hinds' company will be ordered to take post at Mesilla. The officer and twenty men, named as a scout beyond the Waco Tanks in my letter to you dated the 2nd instant, will not needed to be kept upon that duty during the time Captain Roberts' expedition is in the field.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,
