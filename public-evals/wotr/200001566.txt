HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DEPARTMENT, Cincinnati, June 13, 1864-6. 15 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,
Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

The officers and men of the One hundred and seventy-first and One hundred and sixty-eight Ohio National Gaurd, who were captured on the 11th of June at and near Cynthiana, Ky., have arrived in this city, and I have sent them to Camp Dennison. They have been paroled, but so far as I can learn, in an unauthorized manner. So soon as I can get a report it will be forwarded. General Hobson and the field officers are at Falmouth, Ky., on some conditional parole, the terms of which I have not learned. The latest information from General Burbridge is to about noon yesterday, when he was in close pursuit of Morgan, first going north and the east. A portion of the troops of this department are still in Kentucky, occupying the fled-works in front of Covington and the railroad to Falmouth, and cannot now be withdrawn. I will return to-night to Columbus.

S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Major-General.
