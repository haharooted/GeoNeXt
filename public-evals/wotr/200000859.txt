FORT SUMTER, January 10, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that Captain J. B. Allston, 6 officers, and 100 men, from Twenty-seventh South Carolina Volunteers, relieved Captain Hammond, 6 officers, and 100 men, from Twenty-fifth South Carolina Volunteers. The steamer left the wharf without a proper head of steam and began drifting with the tide below the fort. Seeing that she ran great risk of being fired into by Sullivan's Island, as well as by the enemy, I directed both the telegraphic and signal operators to call Sullivan's Island. They tried for twenty minutes, from 12.30 to 12.50, without success. At the wharf; injured part successfully removed by Major Rhett, surgeon in charge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON.
