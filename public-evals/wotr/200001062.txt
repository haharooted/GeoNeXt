HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Big Shanty, June 14, 1864-3 p. m.

(Received 7. 10 p. m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,
Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

General Sherman is at the front, advancing his lines on Kenesaw. This is the first fair day for the past two weeks, and all is going on well.

General Burbridge has already received General Sherman's high commendations for his success and energy. He has ordered the seizure of fresh horses at any cost and the utter extermination of Morgan and all guerrillas in Kentucky. *

Aide-de-Camp.
