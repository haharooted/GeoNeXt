COLONEL: I have information that there are several droves of cattle from the Indian Territory in Greenwood, Allen, and adjoining counties, in charge of persons professing to have permits from Colonel Phillips and other commanding officers south of this district. I respectfully request to be informed in reference to the instructions of the major-general commanding the department upon this subject, especially whether or not these officers have authority to give such permits.
