GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DISTRICT WEST LOUISIANA, Numbers --.
 In the Field, April 5, 1864.

The major-general commanding desires to express to Brigadier-General Polignac and the officers and men of his brigade his high appreciation of the gallant and soldierly bearing in their engagement of the 1st and 2nd of March, 1864, with the enemy's gun-boats on the Ouachita River. The dispositions made by General Polignac were excellent and were nobly sustained by his command. The gun-boats were successfully engaged at short range with musketry and light artillery, and driven off with heavy loss, by the enemy's own admission. The artillery engaged consisted of two sections of Faries' battery, under Captain Faries, whose conduct is highly praised in General Polignac's report. Our men were entirely without cover.

By command of Major-General Taylor:

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
