THIBODEAUX, LA., January 22, 1864-5 p.m.

(Received 7 p.m.)

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

Notwithstanding the anxiety expressed by some officers, I am fully satisfied that the Confederates have no force of any size in or about this district. It is may decided opinion that the railroad was cut by a party of 5 men, acting under orders, and for the purpose not only of destroying some of the trains conveying troops, but also to cause uneasiness among the inhabitants and to render them timid in registering their names for the purpose of voting. I have reliable parties of mounted men scouting along the lakes and the bayous to counteract any such impressions and to arrest suspicious persons. As the weak part of the railroad is between Bayou Boeuf and Tigerville, would it be as well for me to patrol that section every night by means of a hand-car? The Second Louisiana Infantry was detailed at Brashear City without my knowledge or consent, and I regret it as being needless and tending to cause useless excitement. Precautions can be taken without this.

E. L. MOLINEUX,

Colonel, Commanding.
