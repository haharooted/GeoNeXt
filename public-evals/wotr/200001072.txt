JUNE 12, 1864-9. 15 p. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY:

Jack Allen's force has been driven from Frankfort. I think your information correct - his being at Lawrenceburg. General Burbridge gained a complete victory over Morgan, at Cynthiana, this morning. Three hundred of Morgan's men, under Giltner, all making toward Lawrenceburg. I have traced them through Versailles. These last are demoralized. I have directed Weatherford, at Lebanon, to be on watch for them, and have informed General Ewing they may strike across this way or near Camp Nelson.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
