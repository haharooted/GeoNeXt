Numbers 1. Reports of Brigadier General George A. Custer, U. S. Army, commanding expedition.

HEADQUARTERS, Near Madison Court-House, March 1, 1864-6 p. m.

SIR: I have just arrived at this point with my entire command. I will send a full report of my operations. My command is now being fed. I will report of my operations. My command is now be very much worn. I found Charlottesville and the brigade over the Rivanna guarded by four batteries of artillery, two brigades of cavalry, and a very large force of infantry. This will be sufficient reason for my not having destroyed the railroad bridge, but I destroyed the fine frame bridge over that steam, within 2 miles of the railroad; captured and destroyed a large camp of the enemy,
after driving them from it; captured 6 caissons loaded with ammunition, 2 forges, and harness for both caissons and forges; burnt 3 large flouring mills filled with grain; captured 1 standard bearing the Virginia State arms; captured about 500 horses, 2 Government wagons, one loaded with bacon, and on my return was cut off by a large force of cavalry and artillery under Generals Stuart and Wickham. My command cut its way through without losing a man, except a few wounded. The enemy had several killed,a large number wounded, and we captured over 50 prisoners. Since yesterday morning I have marched 100 miles.

Very respectfully,

G. A. CUSTER,

Brigadier-General.
