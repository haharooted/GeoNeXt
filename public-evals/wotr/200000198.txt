JANUARY 23-27, 1864.-Scout from Patterson, Mo., to Cherokee Bay, Ark.

Report of Captain William T. Leeper, Third Missouri State Militia Cavalry.

PATTERSON, January 27, 1864.

SIR: Captain Johns has returned all safe. He has marched near 300 miles; been all over the Cherokee Bay. The captain and the swamp scouts found no force only Reves and 20 men. He killed 4 of Reves' men, and chased Reves for miles, and run him into the river. Captain Johns learned that a fight had taken place at Batersville, rebels commanded by Colonel Shaver, and that they were badly whipped and Colonel Shaver was killed, and that Jacksonport was evacuated by our forces, and that General McRae had taken possession of it. This was a bold dash for 24 men.

W. T. LEEPER,

Commanding Post.

Colonel WOODSON,

Commanding Post at Pilot Knob, Mo.
