HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,
Tunnel Hill, Ga., May 10, 1864.

Brigadier General E. M. McCOOK,

Commanding First Division Cavalry:

GENERAL: Your note announcing the action of yesterday has been received.* The enemy avoids showing his troops and batteries, making it necessary to be very cautious. If the death of Colonel La Grange is beyond doubt, the loss of so estimable a man and gallant officer is to be greatly deplored. Give me as full particulars as you can, and at an early date, of every occurrence. Grant's victory over Lee is complete.

Yours, respectfully,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
