FORT SMITH, April 11, 1864.

General KIMBALL:

The Ninth Kansas was at Fort Scott on the 7th. The post at Rosecrans all right. Clarksville threatened by 500 men. Have ordered re-enforcements from Roseville. Send what you can spare from Dardanelle. River not rising. Where is General Thayer?

W. R. JUDSON,

Colonel, Commanding.
