CHARLESTON, April 21, 1864. (Received 7.35, 22nd.)

The instructions conveyed in your letter of the 7th instant to General Beauregard, and reiterated in your telegram of to-day to me, shall be carried out, but the enemy is now making threatening demonstrations near the batteries manned by some of the companies named, and I beg that I may be allowed to retain them as they are for a few days and until I can communicate with you more fully on the subject.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General S. COOPER.
