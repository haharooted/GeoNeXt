HDQRS. ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,
Cold Harbor, Va., June 3, 1864-3 p.m.

(Received 8 a.m., 4th)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

In view of the time it would take to get orders to New Orleans and to transport troops from there here, I do not think it advisable to bring the Nineteenth Corps to this field. Since Banks' disaster, too, all the troops in the Trans-Mississippi Division may be required there. If there are any surplus troops West they could be advantageously used against Mobile, as suggested in Sherman's dispatch of May 30. Please so order. Let Reynolds of Franklin command the expedition. The sixty pontoon-boats coming from New York, with what we have here and at Fort Monroe, will be sufficient.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
