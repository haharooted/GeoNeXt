DECATUR, May 9, 1864.

Major General J. E. SMITH:

I have received no report from General Gresham of the distribution of his force. He is at Prospect to-night with part of his command. One regiment is at Athens. I have telegraphed to know where the Seventeenth Army Corps is, but have not learned.

J. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
