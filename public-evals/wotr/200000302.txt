PILOT KNOB, MO., January 28, 1864.

General FISK:

Company C, Third Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, is at Centreville. They will not be caught napping again. Companies A and L at Patterson; Company I at Fredericktown, and Company H at Famington. I believe Leeper will keep me informed of any force in his front. I had information about a week ago that the guerrillas wee collecting in force on the border. I felt strong enough to manage them, and did not think it necessary to annoy you with small affairs. I am confirmed in my opinion that Johns has just returned safely from Arkansas with small scout.

R. G. WOODSON,

Colonel, Commanding.
