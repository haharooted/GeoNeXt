HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,
San Francisco, October 30, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have already written to you asking for authority to raise another regiment of infantry in this State, and also to raise seven additional companies of cavalry to complete the organization of the First California Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, now in New Mexico, and composed of only five companies. Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, of the First Cavalry, is now here, having been sent from New Mexico with dispatches by General Carleton, and if the authority is granted for the additional cavalry companies I will thank you to inform me by telegraph in order that no time may be lost.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
