HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, March 16, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that on the morning of the 26th of February I received the following order, dated--

CONFIDENTIAL.] HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, February 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General KILPATRICK,
Commanding Third Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: Your command, increased to 4,000 men with one battery, will be placed in readiness to move on the raid to Richmond for the purpose of liberating our prisoners at that place.

You will start on Sunday evening, the 28th instant, and will proceed by such routes and make such dispositions as from time to time you may find necessary to accomplish the object of the expedition. You will not be confined to any specific instructions in reference to such matters. Colonel Ulric Dahlgren is authorized to accompany you, and will render valuable assistance from his knowledge to accompany you, and will render valuable assistance from his knowledge of the country and his well-known gallantry, intelligence, and energy. Important diversions will be made in your favor, the particulars of which you have been already advised. That these may be more fully and completely carried out you will direct Brigadier-General Custer to report in person to these headquarters until further orders. With my best wishes for a perfect success, and the assurance that every effort will be exerted by the service here to insure it,

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
