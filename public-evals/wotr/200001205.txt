HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARIZONA,
Mesilla, September 28, 1862.

Lieutenant BEN. C. CUTLER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Santa Fe:

I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders from the general commanding, Lieutenant-Colonel Rigg left Mesilla this morning with Companies F and I, First, and B, Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, to relieve the garrison at Fort Craig. A train of twenty wagons accompanied this command, under orders to proceed to Peralta and report to Captain Enos, assistant quartermaster. Under similar instructions Captain Fritz's company (B), First Cavalry California Volunteers, marched for Tucson this morning with a train of twenty wagons. The instructions to the commanding officer at Tucson have been already transmitted to you. Eight days elapsed since I first received the orders for these movements. The delay has been caused by the necessity of sending to San Elizario, Tex., for forage.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
