LEXINGTON, KY., June 13, 1864.

Colonel J. W. WEATHERFORD,

Lebanon and Danville Road:

Rebels turned south this side the river; crossed the pike between Camp Nelson and Nicholasville, and are making for mouth of Paint Lick. Have not heard of Jack Allen's force this morning. The force that crossed Nicholasville pike is variously estimated from 3-- to 1,000, badly demoralized. General Fry's cavalry is capturing some prisoners. I have sent a force from here on Tate's Creek road.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
