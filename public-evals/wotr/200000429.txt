Saint Louis, April 11, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. N. HERDER,

Commanding, Pilot Knob:

You will by all means cross the river at any time to kill guerrillas and break up their camps. I want none of them taken prisoners. But no squad must cross except under a commissioned officer, who will be held responsible for the conduct of his men. Such robberies as were committed by Captain Milks' men must not be allowed to recur. You will exert yourself to recover the property stolen and bring the offenders to justice.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
