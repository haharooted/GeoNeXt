IN FIELD,

About five miles from Resaca, May 9, 1864-2 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding, &c.,

GENERAL: Dispatch received.* My advance is within one mile and a half of Resaca. So far we have only met cavalry; had a sharp little skirmish with a brigade which arrived this morning and intended to get the gap and hold it, but we were too quick from them. Cannot learn whether there is any considerable force of infantry at Resaca or not; expect to find out shortly. If I succeeded in breaking the railroad I intend to withdrawn my command back and take a strong defensive position on the east entrance to the gap and await orders from Major-General Sherman.

Sincerely, yours,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
