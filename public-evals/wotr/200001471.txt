HEADQUARTERS,
Springfield, May 29, 1864-2.30 p.m.

General J. R. WEST:

I have just received information from Mr. Williams a son of Captain Jesse Williams, who was taken prisoner and released on the east side of Whit River, that Shelby would cross White River 12 miles above Batesville, and intended joining McRae and operating with him when a good opportunity offered, when he intended bringing McRae with him and rejoin Price. Rations, horseshoes, &c., arrived at 10 o'clock this a.m. All my horses will be shod and be on the march at 7 o'clock to-morrow morning.

Respectfully,

W. F. GEIGER,

Colonel, Commanding.
