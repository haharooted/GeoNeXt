LEXINGTON, KY., June 11, 1864--1 p. m.

Brigadier General H. B. CARRINGTON,

Louisville, Ky.:

Have heard nothing of or from Governor Bramlette. Rebels left here yesterday morning for Georgetown; supposed to have gone east from there. General Burbridge started in pursuit with fresh horses last night, and will push them up and fight them steadily.
