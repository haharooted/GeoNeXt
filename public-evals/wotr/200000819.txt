SUMTER, January 27, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that Captain Culpepper and 7 officers and 100 enlisted men, from Colquitt's brigade, relieved last night Captain Elliott, 6 officers, and 100 enlisted men, from same brigade. Two shots fired at the fort yesterday, one of which missed. Too hazy to see fleet.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. T. MILES.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
