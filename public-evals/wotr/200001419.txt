HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,
Saint Louis, Mo., April 13, 1864.

Admiral D. D. PORTER:

SIR: Personal experience in this department has fully satisfied me of the very great importance of having an able and thoroughly reliable detective at Memphis. With such an officer there, having a clear and full understanding with the provost-marshal-general of this department, I am persuaded that the contraband trade and travel on the river, between here and Memphis, could be broken up and a great public good accomplished. Permit me, therefore, to suggest the propriety of authorizing Lieutenant J. B. Devoe, who is now here, to take up his quarters, for a while at Memphis, and take charge there of the duties indicated.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
