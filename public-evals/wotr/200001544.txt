HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, Jacksonville, July 22, 1864.

Colonel A. L. HARRIS,
Commanding Seventy-fifth Ohio Volunteers:

COLONEL: Everything in this expedition depends upon the promptness of your embarkation at Mandarin and of your debarkation. You must have your horses ready on the Mandarin wharf, your forage and men, and load the boats quickly, and send them off as fast as loaded. If you fail in this, from not being ready, or from allowing your men to be slow, you will cause my whole expedition to fail, for I must land you at night and get the boats out of the creek before daylight, or there will be no surprise. Be ready, then, when the boats get to the dock. Get your men and horses on board within twenty minutes.

Very respectfully,

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
