Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER,
Commanding, Macon, Mo.:

Concentrate Companies H and I, Ninth Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, at the best point for them to care well for Chariton, Randolph, Howard, and Boone Counties. Tell Captain Glaze we shall hold him responsible for the good order of said counties, and for the extermination therefrom of guerrillas and thieves. Order in all the small detachments on duty as guards for recruiting officers for negroes, where the officer is doing nothing. We can't afford body guards for officers doing nothing.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
