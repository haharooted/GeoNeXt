FORT SMITH, ARK., January 26, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

To whom shall the troops at Waldron, Van Buren, Roseville, and Clarksville, Ark., report? Are all the troops stationed in the vicinity of Fort Smith to be considered as forming part of its garrison? Are the headquarters the District of the Frontier in the Department of the Missouri or in the Department of Kansas? Having charge of the return, I ask for information. The colonel commanding if of the opinion that all the troops serving in the District of the Frontier are transferred to the Department of Kansas. I cannot agree with him.

C. G. LAURANT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
