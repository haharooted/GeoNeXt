HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Hilton Head, S. C., July 16, 1864.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Commanding Confederate Forces, Dept. of S. C., Ga., and Fla.:

GENERAL: Regarding the case of Dr. W. T. Robinson, of the One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers, captured by you pickets on John's Island, I deem it proper to say that at the time of his capture he was not, as you stat in your letter of the 13th instant appeared to be the case, "reconnoitering the country." Having been detained as the regiment moved in the morning on professional duty, he missed his way in following, and thus met your pickets. With respect to the custom of liberating surgeons when captured, I have to say that it has been my custom while in command both in North Carolina and East Tennessee. Your action in the present case will determine whether the custom will be continued in this department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
