HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,
Helena, Ark., May 30, 1864

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. STIBBS,

Commanding Batt. Twelfth Iowa, Mouth of White River:

SIR: I have just received the following order:

HEADQUARTERS DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,

May 25, 1864.

Brigadier General N. B. BUFORD,

Commanding,&c. Helena, Ark.:

SIR: The major-general commanding requests that you will reduce the force now stationed at the mouth of White River to 50 men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. MELVILLE,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

In compliance with it you will detail the captain most fitted to be left in a separate command with delicate duties to perform with one or more lieutenants and 50 men, with rations up to the 16th of June, camp and garrison equipage, and 100 rounds of ammunition to the man, and embark in the first steam-boat you can obtain with all the remainder of your command for Memphis, where you will report to Major General C. C. Washburn. I see by your morning report of the 28th that some of your companies are so small that you may have to detail two companies, or one company and part of another, to meet the requirements of this order. You will use your sound discretion in the selection, leaving the first and second in command, both calculated for a separate command. I inclose instructions for the officer you leave in command. You will please report to me as you pass this place.

Your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Commanding.
