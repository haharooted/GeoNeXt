HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,
Fort Humboldt, June 11, 1863.

COLONEL: On the 6th instant a citizen pack train of thirty-seven mules, with a citizen escort of five men, fell into an Indian ambush near Oak Camp, about fifteen miles this side of Fort Gaston. Tow of the men were shot, one killed, and the other escaped wounded, arriving at Hoopa Valley the same night. The remainder ran back to Fawn Prarie the camp of Captain Ousley's company (B) of mountaineers. Lieutenant Hempfield started at once with thirty-six men, arriving at the scene of attack five hours after it occurred. They have failed, however, to find the Indians. Immediately on the arrival of the wounded man in the valley Lieutenant-Colonel Olney dispatched Lieutenant Winchill with five men (being all that could be spared, several escorts being then out) to render what assistance he could. Lieutenant Winchill arrived at the place of attack at 3. 30 o'clock in the morning. All that he could do was to employ his detachment to escort to Hoopa Valley a portion of the train and cargo which the Indians had left on the ground.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,

Colonel Second Infantry California Vols., Commanding Humboldt Mil. Dist.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Pacific.
