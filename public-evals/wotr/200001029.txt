HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,
New Orleans, May 25, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to request that the quartermaster's department may be ordered to furnish Brigadier General D. P. Woodbury, commanding District of Key West and Tortugas, with two strong side-wheel steamers, drawing not over 7 feet when loaded, capable of carrying each 500 men; adapted also to carrying horses, cattle, and freight. These steamers should be strong enough for constant sea service, and to be able to carry at least 300 men under cover. Each steamer should have four large boats. With these vessels General Woodbury is of opinion that he can interfere very successfully with the driving of cattle in Florida by the Confederates, and can procure and abundant supply for his own command.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
