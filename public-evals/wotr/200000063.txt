HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,
Tunnel Hill, May 10, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps, Buzzard Roost Gap:

GENERAL: It has been decided to leave your corps with Stoneman's and McCook's cavalry, to keep up the feint of a direct attack on Dalton through Buzzard Roost Gap, and to move the remainder of the three armies through Snake Creek Gap, and attack the enemy in force from that quarter. You will, therefore, at once proceed to make the necessary preparations, stripping your command light, sending all spare wagons to Ringgold. The cars will continue to run here with daily supplies, but the main stores will be at Ringgold. Instruct the cavalry to watch well the passes north of Tunnel Hill and at Ray's Gap. Geary, who is at the latter place, will remain there until relieved by McCook's cavalry, when he will join his corps. In case the enemy should detect the diminution of force and attack you, you will gradually fall back in the direction of Ringgold but defend that point at all costs. The chief engineer of the railroad will be ordered to keep a locomotive and construction train here, prepared, if this retrograde movement becomes necessary, to take up at intervals rails, so as to make a repair train necessary to replace them; this that the enemy may not use the railroad to facilitate his movement in pursuit.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
