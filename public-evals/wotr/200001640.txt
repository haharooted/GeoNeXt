[Inclosure W.] HEADQUARTERS COLUMN FROM CALIFORNIA, Albuquerque, N. Mex., September 14, 1862.

Colonel JOSEPH R. WEST,

First California Volunteer Infantry, Commanding Dist. of Arizona:

COLONEL: By the same express which carries this letter you will receive an order from department headquarters directing you to send troops to Fort Craig to relieve the garrison now at that post. The general commanding directs that you send for this purpose Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Rigg, First California Volunteer Infantry, with about 200 rank and file, so selected as not to take from your command more than three companies. Captain Fritz, First California Volunteer Cavalry, will proceed to Tucson, as previously directed, with twenty-five wagons. If Wagon-Master Veck has not already started for Peralta with fifteen wagons, as directed, the general commanding orders that his train be increased to thirty-five wagons. If he has already started, send twenty additional wagons when Colonel Rigg goes to Fort Craig. Wagon-Master Francis will go with Captain Fritz to Tucson, and Winston will remain with the rest of the wagons.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BEN. C. CUTLER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
