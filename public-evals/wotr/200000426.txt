HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT, Saint Louis, April 14, 1864.

Colonel ROGERS,
Commanding, Cape Girardeau:

If you are satisfied there is such a force gathering there, march as soon as practicable and rout it. Do not move until you are satisfied, for more than half the reports of this character are ill founded. The commission will be postponed if you should be necessarily absent.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
