Gabon: AYC - Flying Eagles Keep Hope Alive With Gabon Victory

Nigeria was saved the embarrassment of a first round exit from the ongoing Africa Youth Championship as the Flying Eagles on Wednesday night managed a 1-0 victory over their Gabonese counterparts.

The slim win nonetheless keeps alive the twin ambition of the Nigerian side to not only defend their title, but also qualify for the World Youth Championships in Turkey.

Skipper Abduljeleel Ajagun saved Coach John Obuh and his bench the heartache of back-to-back defeat as he made the difference with his 20th minute well taken penalty kick which separated both sides after 90 minutes.

The Flying Eagles like in their first game against the Junior Eagles of Mali dominated play and created myriad of chances but failed to get any in the back of net aside the penalty kick converted by Ajagun.

The Gabonese came very close to equalising deep into stoppage time.

Kayode Olarenwaju was the greatest culprit on the night for Nigeria as he had many chances but was either denied a goal by his finishing touch or the heroics of the Gabonese Keeper.

Wednesday night's victory has taken Nigeria off from her previously occupied bottom place as they have moved to second spot in their Group with 3 points behind Mali who have 6 points from two games.

The Flying Eagles will now take on the Democratic Republic of Congo in their last group match and they only need to avoid defeat to be sure of their progress at the ongoing AYC in Algeria.
