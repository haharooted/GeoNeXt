Two dead, one injured in Melbourne wall collapse

Two young people were killed and another injured when a brick wall collapsed on a busy Melbourne street.

A swarm of people dug through bricks and rubble but could not save two pedestrians crushed when a wall collapsed on a busy Melbourne street.

A man and a woman, believed to be in their late teens, were killed when a 15-metre long section of brick wall fell on Swanston Street in Carlton.

A 19-year-old woman suffered life-threatening injuries in the collapse on Thursday afternoon.

Witnesses say passers-by dug desperately through the rubble to help the people trapped underneath.

"I just frantically ran across and started digging because I could see their head and half their torso out, so I was frantically taking the bricks off her," Martin Setka told AAP.

"The whole wall just gave way."

Another witness, Jonathan Lian, said the scene resembled a war zone.

Mr Lian was sitting in a cafe opposite when the wall collapsed, and came out to see people running towards the wall.

"It was really bad. It was like a war zone," he said.

"There was dust everywhere, and they were trying to dig people out. It was like chaos."

Inspector Ian Lindsay said it appeared that strong wind gusts had caused the wall to collapse.

"It appears they've just been pedestrians in the wrong place at the wrong time when the wall has collapsed," he told reporters.

He said police were yet to confirm the identity of the people killed.

The collapse occurred at the old Carlton & United brewery site, which is now a vacant building lot owned by Grocon.

The company has said it plans to develop the site, which it purchased in 2006, but no construction work is currently underway.

The site is near Melbourne University and RMIT, but it is not known if any of the three young people were students.

The injured woman has undergone surgery and remains in a critical condition in the Royal Melbourne Hospital.
