Mini guide to the Peloponnese, Greece

The Peloponnese in southern Greece is the stuff legends are made of, literally. Here, Greek gods and heroes strutted their stuff in historical cities such as Ancient Olympia. The landscape is equally impressive, from some of Greece’s finest beaches on the southernmost peninsula Mani, to the flower-covered mountains of Arkadia.

Eat and drink

I Stemnitsa is the only year-round taverna in the mountain village of Stemnitsa. Tables are arranged under giant umbrellas and they serve a good Greek menu. The local butcher owns it, so expect generous, quality cuts of meat (00 30 27950 81371; Stemnitsa; lunch and dinner; mains from £3).

Getting around

Slow trains connect main towns. There’s a reasonable network of buses serving Nafplio, Epidavros, Mycenae and Kalamata, but they are often slow and services to smaller villages infrequent. To really explore, hire a car in Nafplio (£35 per day; europcar.com).

When to go

Visit in spring when the mountains are swathed in flowers, or between June and September to catch the Patras International Festival, featuring a range of visiting performers.
