Denmark festival ideal for music enthusiasts

For music lovers, it has been announced that the Danish Roskilde festival will host Jack White in 2012, providing a huge attraction for holidaymakers wanting to travel to music events in Europe this year. A great line-up of acts, including The Cure, Bjork and Bruce Springsteen, are set to take to the stages at the festival near Copenhagen, making the event one of the largest musical festivals in Europe.

Summer is often a time of festivals in the UK, and in Europe there is also a strong tradition of music events in the warmer months of the years. For those wanting to indulge in a Scandinavian retreat, the Roskilde Festival boasts a line-up of over 200 acts and this year also hosts the new Dream City camping area, which will include workshops and festivalgoer ideas.

Talking of the event, music director of the festival, Rikke &Oslash;xner said: “It's a difficult art presenting an artist at the perfect time in their career, but I think we've succeeded in doing so with a large part of our bookings. Needless to say, we also need to present timeless artists such as The Cult, Alison Krauss and Machine Head, as well as the brand new artists, whose great career still lies ahead of them.” For those wanting to enjoy music and an incredible country, Denmark is ideal for summer 2012.
