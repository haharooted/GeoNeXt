The man known as Canada's "Prince of Pot" says he's "feeling good" after spending a night in a Montreal
            jail.
            Marc Emery, who operates an illegal chain of marijuana shops under the name of "Cannabis Culture," was
            arrested along with nine others on Friday evening during a series of raids by Montreal police.
            Police were targeting six new Cannabis Culture locations that had just opened the day before.
            Emery, who was working at the store on Mont-Royal Avenue, is now charged with drug trafficking, possession
            for the purpose of trafficking and conspiracy.
            Emery was released after posting a $5,000 bond and is prohibited from consuming cannabis, entering places
            that produce or sell cannabis, or communicating with anyone linked to Cannabis Culture operations in Montreal.
            Speaking to reporters after his release on Saturday, Emery said he is not allowed to stay in Quebec and can
            only return if it is for a court date.
            It's unclear if the stores will reopen, he added, because he cannot be in the province and authorities are
            pressuring the landlords to keep the locations closed.
            On Saturday, Montreal police officers were seen checking the properties to ensure that they were not in
            operation.
