A Texas court on Wednesday exonerated four women convicted of sexual assault in the 1990s after
            lawyers argued that they were sent to prison because of junk science, tainted testimony and false ideas of
            lesbian behavior.
            The Court of Criminal Appeals said the convictions of the so-called "San Antonio Four" for sexually
            assaulting two children, ages 7 and 9, did not pass "the smell test." With testimony recanted since the
            trial and new evidence, no reasonable juror could have found the women guilty, the court said.
            "Those defendants have won the right to proclaim to the citizens of Texas that they did not commit a crime,"
            the written ruling said. "They are innocent. And they are exonerated."
            Cassandra Rivera, Elizabeth Ramirez, Kristie Mayhugh and Anna Vasquez were sentenced to prison terms ranging
            from 15 to 37 years and each served more than a decade. They were released on bond a few years ago as the
            convictions began to unravel.
            "They are overjoyed at the decision. They will all be having great Thanksgivings," said Mike Ware an
            attorney with Innocence Project of Texas and the lead appellate counsel for the four.
            The four maintained their innocence and their supporters have slammed testimony presented by the state's
            star medical witness at trial, pediatrician Nancy Kellogg.
            Kellogg testified about what she said were physical injuries inflicted upon the girls as part of satanic
            rituals that she said were prevalent among some lesbians.Kellogg later retracted her testimony and agreed
            with defense claims that there were no signs of physical abuse, the appeals court said.
