Toronto resident Sarah Vermelhudo cared deeply for her godson Shayne MacDonald, the 21-year-old nephew she hung out with "all the time."
            "She never had any children of her own, so she treated Shayne like she was his mom, almost," recalled
            Vermelhudo's cousin, Jenny Palma, a salon owner in Toronto.
            Now, Palma and other family members are trying to comprehend a shocking turn of events:
            38-year-old Vermelhudo is dead after being stabbed on Friday. MacDonald is now the subject of a Canada-wide
            warrant and faces charges of second-degree and attempted murder.
            "She had a heart of gold," Palma said in an emotional phone call with CBC Toronto. "This was really
            unbelievable."
            Police say the attempted murder charge is in connection with the stabbing of Vermelhudo's 59-year-old
            mother, Maria Vermelhudo.
            MacDonald was a staple in Sarah Vermelhudo's life, Palma said, and it's not yet clear what happened on
            Friday night while the two were spending
            time together at the Little Portugal home Vermelhudo shared with her mother.
            Det.-Sgt. Graham Gibson of the Toronto police homicide squad said police believe MacDonald went to the house
            on College Street near Dufferin Street around 8 p.m.
            During the visit, family members on the main floor heard screaming and a struggle happening upstairs.
            Gibson said Vermelhudo came downstairs, suffering from stab wounds. Family members tried to help, including
            her mother, who was injured as well.
            Both women were taken to St. Michael's Hospital, and while Maria was treated and released, Vermelhudo died
            from her wounds. Her body was scheduled to undergo a postmortem examination on Saturday.
