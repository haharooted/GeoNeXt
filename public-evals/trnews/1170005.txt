AN Edmonton man who carried out a “vicious assault” on a woman he knew leaving her with multiple stab wounds has been jailed for 10 years.
The 49-year-old victim was stabbed a number of times by Taleh Habibzade who called the police after the attack in Seaton Street, Edmonton, at 3.20pm, on Friday, February 3,
The victim was taken to an east London hospital and has since been discharged.
Habibzade was arrested at the scene on suspicion of attempted murder and was charged the following day.
The 48-year-old, of Colton Way, was jailed for 10 after he was found guilty of attempted murder, at Wood Green Crown Court, last Friday (July 21).)
Detective Sergeant Darrensing Bheekoo, from Enfield Borough, said: "Habibzade launched a vicious assault on his victim. She has recovered from her injuries but the memory of that day will always remain with her.
"Habibzade is beginning a lengthy prison sentence and will have time to reflect on his actions."
