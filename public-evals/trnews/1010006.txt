The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is warning people not to eat a frozen chicken and fried rice product recalled by Costco Canada for the second time this year.
            According to the CFIA, there is a risk that the chicken in the ready-to-eat product is undercooked.
            It said the recall was triggered by one in another country.
            The recalled products have best before dates between Sept. 26, 2017, and Nov. 5, 2017. Their product code is
            0-71757-05642-8.
            The CFIA said people should throw out the product or return it to the store where they purchased it.
            The agency had not received any reports of people getting sick from the chicken and fried rice meal.
