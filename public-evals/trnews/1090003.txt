The Red Cross Blood Service says it is concerned about the impact of dengue fever on blood donations in far north Queensland.
Nine cases of the mosquito-borne illness have been confirmed in the Cairns suburbs of Edmonton, Mount Sheridan, Bentley Park, Trinity Beach and Mooroobool.
The Cairns service was forced to close for six months after last year's dengue outbreak, in which 136 people were diagnosed.
Spokeswoman Sandy Holmes is asking potential donors to stay away from the affected areas, if possible.
"If you walk into that area, if you drive your car with your windows down, that is declared that you are in that area, at that time," she said.
"If they've been to perhaps one of the shopping centres in the area or perhaps one of the waterslide parks or something like that, they won't be able to donate whole blood at the moment but they will be able to make a plasma donation."
