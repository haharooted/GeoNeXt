Instagram said it had fixed a "bug" that saw users geo-tag themselves as being in Singapore in a bid to go viral - even though they were not there.
            Some users claimed the apparent hack increased the chances of a post reaching the coveted Explore page on
            the photo-sharing app.
            Posts in that section are likely to get many more likes and attract followers.
            Instagram confirmed to the BBC that it was a "bug that impacted engagement" when posts were tagged with
            Singapore.
            Like on Facebook, what appears on your Instagram is based on the firm's algorithm. The spokesperson added
            that they have now fixed the issue.
            The trend started when dozens of prominent "influencers" were seen tagging their Instagram photos with the
            location "Singapore, Singapore", despite being nowhere near the South East Asian city-state.
            In a technology feature published earlier this week, Tech Mic reported that the trick caught on with
            internet stars like King Bach and Christian Collins, who began geo-tagging their posts to gain wider reach.
